       "{'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/style/modern-love-seeking-a-father-for-my-child-relationship-optional.html': ['Two days before I left South Dakota, Rex and I sat talking beneath the open hatchback of my car. In the distance, a lightning storm moved toward us over the open expanse of the Great Plains, churning the sky a murky purple. He was talking passionately about lithium batteries. The more he talked, the less he and I seemed to have in common. I considered myself someone who could become interested in almost anything, especially when I was attracted to the person speaking. But now I asked myself: Did I care about batteries? He and I were volunteers on the Pine Ridge Reservation, building and repairing infrastructure. He had been the first person to greet me when I arrived at the end of the long, dirt road. When he climbed out of the cab of a skid loader, and I saw his face, my body warmed. In the lyrical version of what happened as the storm approached, we would have stopped talking and taken seriously the pleasure of our bodies. But wanting to have a baby had made dating in my late 30s less like a poem and more like a math problem. There was a lot that had to line up, and what I was looking for now differed from what my younger self had envisioned. I didn’t care about dating someone for a certain amount of time before we had a baby, or being in love, or getting married. I wanted to like the biological father of my child, maybe admire him. That was about it. I had arrived at this set of criteria because the alternatives seemed sentimental and unrealistic, especially the husband-to-be wish lists that many of us champion during those years when we are both ready and able to have children. With the help of my sitting meditation practice, I had observed that the more I worried about getting pregnant, the less discerning I was about love, an effect I feared would intensify as I got older. How could I trust my judgment under pressure? Wouldn’t a lot of men start to smell like fathers? I decided the safest way to protect myself against romantic delusion would be to separate the two stories from the outset: I could try to find a mate or become a mother, but not at the same time. Since biological constraints made it easy to figure out which was more urgent, I resolved to have a child outside of the context of love. My solo road trip to South Dakota was conceived as an experience my future self, the one saddled with a dependent, would someday thank me for. When I returned home, I planned to get pregnant using an anonymous donor’s sperm. On my last evening with Rex, kissing in his tent, I realized there was a lot about him I didn’t know — who was in his life, where he worked, his last name. Before I crawled out of his tent, he asked for my phone number. He was headed home to Michigan, and I to California. I told him I thought we should leave things exactly as they were, which seemed perfect to me. “What, are you crazy?” he said, and he gave me his number. Back home, I pored over donor questionnaires at the local sperm bank, trying to keep straight who liked video games and who preferred billiards, but it all mixed blandly together for me. Phone conversations with Rex, though, were weird and memorable. He had inherited his father’s expressions such as “Son of a biscuit!” and “Jeez O’Pete’s!” Doting on his backyard laying hens, he often referred to himself as a “chicken mama.” He was the only 30-something adult I knew who had traveled on an airplane exactly once, a domestic round trip for a former job. We didn’t talk much about the parts of our lives that existed beyond the present. He mentioned that his relationship with a woman in Michigan was crumbling. All he knew of my path to motherhood was that I wanted a child. When my search for a donor stagnated from lacking a warm feeling about any of them, friends offered to screen profiles with me on the eve of my 40th birthday. Two donors received my friends’ approval, so I put myself on the wait-list for their sperm, though I still felt ambivalent. When I finally told Rex about my stalled plan to become a mother, he said, “I can help you with that.” I was silent. Then I said, “Don’t say something like that without thinking about it.” “I have.” He wasn’t interested in being a father or co-parent, so the scenarios we discussed assumed that by the time I gave birth, he and I no longer would be romantically involved. Soon he visited me in California and had his first experience soaking naked with strangers in hot springs, his first contact with thousand-year-old redwood trees (he cried). He gave back rubs that were accurate, not clumsy; his hands were full of life. We were still working on our donor arrangement. We were also falling in love. I went to stay with him in Michigan, where he taught me how to use a chain saw and care for chickens. Eventually, he followed me back to California, driving the whole way towing a homemade trailer filled with tools. During this time, we were trying to live two separate stories: the one in which every month we tried to conceive, and the other in which we were still getting to know each other. But the more we enjoyed ourselves, the more confusing our situation became. If I got pregnant, would he leave the relationship? If I didn’t get pregnant, would I switch to another donor? About a year after he offered to be my donor, we began to have these difficult conversations. And in the middle of them, I got pregnant. Such was his generosity that he was genuinely thrilled for me. Inwardly, though, he began to withdraw. He still didn’t want to be a father or co-parent; the thought of either brought up old wounds from his childhood. Every day of his indecision, I was tempted to try to convince him to stay. Most days, I had enough sanity to recognize that doing this would harm us both. On the day he left California, he took a photograph of me looking haunted. Then he got in his car and drove east. It was Father’s Day. After he left, I scrambled into action, interviewing midwives, searching online for used baby gear, and trying to explain to the being in my womb why I was crying a lot: “I’m sorry, baby. I’m OK, just sad.” Then weeks later, without warning, a text arrived: “I made a terrible mistake.” By then, I recognized he wasn’t the only one. When love and a baby coincided for me, I still believed I could separate the two and remain fundamentally unchanged. Not until Rex and I were suffering was I able to see that the clean reality I envisioned had never existed between us. It had evaporated the moment he greeted me at the end of the dirt road, and my body responded with warmth. Buddhism is founded on the truth that suffering is caused by desire, which at first glance can make both suffering and desire sound unequivocally bad. But the beauty of suffering is that it offers the opportunity to have a curious and tender relationship with desire, to listen to it rather than try to eradicate it. Often what I hear beneath my desire’s surface noise isn’t problematic, only human: the vulnerability in having a life tangled up with others. In Rex’s absence, I remembered that tending to a lover or child is dirty work, in the most wholesome sense. We don’t fall in love or have a baby to have our points of view and preferences affirmed. We do it, at least a little bit, to soften our singular, lonesome grip on reality and invite in the unexpected, the undesirable and the inexplicable. This — call it messiness, or richness, or hands full of life — is what is beautiful and natural about being an animal with appetites beyond our understanding. Being faithful in the deepest sense to a lover or baby is saying yes to the weird and memorable before you know you want it or welcome it. Rex came to this in his own way. He told me that since he left California, he had been listening to podcasts about fatherhood and looking at the photo of me he took the day he left. He’d been crying, too. And he wanted to come back. “To the baby?” I said. “Or to me?” “Both,” he said. And he did. He sold his heaviest tools, repainted walls and put his house in Michigan up for sale. And two months later, he was back in California in time to catch in his hands our son being born.'],\n",
       " 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/18/style/modern-love-i-tried-so-hard-to-be-good.html': ['My husband and I married in a Presbyterian church in Watkins Glen, N.Y., on the banks of Seneca Lake. It was June 2006, three months before he started seminary and five-and-a-half years after I had quit the sex industry. I considered our wedding the marriage of the former stripper and the future minister. After the wedding, I followed the contours of his career with the flexibility and accord of a synchronized swimmer. I left my job at a Vermont newspaper and moved to Boston, where he had enrolled in theological school. While he studied, I read books that told me how to read The Book, how to live The Book. To cross the Jordan, I read, we must die, symbolically. We must give ourselves up, let go and be embodied by Christ. I let go of all my friends, gave up my Blues music (too sexy) and Celtic music (too many mentions of whiskey) and my tight iridescent clothes. My sex toys and handcuffs dropped straight into the garbage. The furniture I had owned was expunged from our lives, the wood buckling on the back porch before we tossed each piece into the trash. Purged of my former life, I started over, guided by this 22-year-old man, seven years younger than I, who was making Jesus his business. He thought he was saving me, and I thought I needed to be saved. In my experience, sex work and Christianity were not incongruous. I only danced for a few months, in San Francisco and New York, to make my rent payments between college and my job as a web developer, but the shame and guilt I felt about stripping pivoted neatly to my role as a good Christian wife. In both cases, I relied on the perceptions of others to define my value. Our first baby was born in the winter, and the next summer we lived at a Baptist summer camp where my husband was employed as the waterfront director. Each day I traversed the camp with the baby in a jogging stroller, juddering down the rocky path to the lake where my husband stood on a dock all day watching the water. After dinner he jumped inside an octagonal pen and played gaga ball with 11-year-old boys while I retreated to our room to nurse the baby because I was not allowed to breastfeed in front of campers. In the evenings, staff gave testimonies of their Christian journeys and led singalongs, campfires and talent shows. By the time my husband came to bed, the baby and I were asleep. When we woke at 7 a.m., he was gone. I read the Bible that summer, Genesis to Revelation. I memorized scriptures. One night I came to the chapel where my husband was preaching to campers and heard him lecture from Leviticus Chapter 11. It is OK, he said, to eat crickets and grasshoppers, but not flies. Locusts are an acceptable snack, but shrimp are forbidden. If you pick up a dead pig, you must wash your clothes. The campers were rapt, and I thought, “He is brilliant, the way he relates the Bible to children.” I didn’t tell anyone I was terrified the Christian community would reject me if they knew I used to be a stripper. My husband told me his career depended on our collective reputation. The camp director’s wife ate meals at our table. She was stout with a round face and creases under her eyes, and she was accessible, meaning she acknowledged that I existed and greeted me in a grumpy but cheerful way. “If I give a testimony,” I asked her, “how much of my story am I supposed to share?” My testimony, I had gathered, was the story of my Christian journey, with answers to these questions: When was I baptized? When did I give my life to Christ? When did I accept Jesus as my Lord and savior? I was baptized as a baby and again with my husband, full immersion, fully clothed, a month after our daughter was born. I had given my life to Christ at the Mission Church in Somerville, Mass., two years earlier. Did the testimony also include the question: When did you conclude there must be a light to lead us out of this dense darkness? When did you feel so wrong you decided to turn around, to repent? Was it in the basement of the Paradise Club, when a man yanked you down and groped you? The camp director’s wife rolled her eyes and said, “Well, that’s up to you to decide.” My full testimony, I thought, might have a shock value similar to the story a man from the kitchen staff told to the new campers about putting a gun to his head and hearing a voice say, “I love you.” I wondered what kind of shocks they were willing to accept. Did they believe strippers could be saved? Some jobs are water, and some are wine. Some evaporate without a trace, and some leave a stain. The Bible studies were segregated by gender, so I went to the women’s Bible study and told them that I was lonely, that I needed a mentor or someone I could talk to about my spiritual path. They listened with wide eyes, then closed them and prayed that I would find someone. By “someone,” they meant someone else. In the lonely vertigo, I found Jesus. Every morning, I sneaked into the back of the log chapel, raised my hand in the air and sang love songs to Jesus. I stood in the last pew, separated from the campers, bouncing my baby if she was awake or, if she was asleep in the reclined stroller, praying that the praise would not wake her. Along with the girls and boys in tie-dyed T-shirts and shaggy hair, I sang quietly over an electronic accompaniment, “Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.” It worked. The eyes of my heart opened, and they wept. My heart ached, and all of it — the isolation, the anonymity, the worry, the pain of seeing but never being seen as I pushed the stroller from road to forest to road, swatting horse flies that dived at my head, even the shock that this life had settled over me like a blanket and smothered my spark — all of it I attributed to Jesus. I was sad because I had sinned. I was lonely because I was cut off from God. Every morning I stood at the back of the chapel and sang, “Here I am to worship,” one hand reaching for the stained glass. If I could humble myself enough to take Jesus into my heart, to die to this world and be reborn as a pure, sinless ray of light, the resurrected me would be a gossamer membrane illuminated like a lantern whose radiance is uneclipsed by an immolated moth carcass. If I could submit to Jesus, maybe I could submit to my husband, like the Bible recommends. I tried so hard to be good. Quieting the babies at night so he could sleep soundly before his exams. Smiling politely when a man would say, “Behind every great man is a great woman,” instead of asking why they stand right in front of us. I felt invisible. From the hyper exposure of bare skin on a spot-lit stage, I had repented and repackaged myself as a pastor’s wife. The pendulum had swung from one extreme to another, and neither felt authentic. I don’t know how the Christian community at the camp would have reacted to my brief stint as a stripper because I never gave a testimony. My fear of them pre-empted their judgment of me. I never allowed them the opportunity to accept me. Stripping is not inherently shameful; by thinking in polarities of good and bad, I ascribed it with shame. In both extremes, I felt incomplete, preferring to categorize my behavior as all bad or all good. I looked to my husband to be my “other half.” When I felt naughty, he seemed holy. When I thought of myself as virtuous, I only saw his faults. The marriage lasted 15 years. As a divorced mother, I have relaxed into my body and learned to see through my own eyes — to look, not to look like; to be, not to pose. I no longer adjust myself according to my reflection in others’ eyes. My body has changed since I danced in clubs more than two decades ago. Birthing four children has stretched my belly from a six-pack to a boule of unbaked bread. It is a mother’s body. It is my body, to embrace and be embraced with love.

       " 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/style/modern-love-gay-couple.html': ['This essay is part of a collaborative project with Black History, Continued. We invited readers and renowned writers to respond to the question “What is Black love today?” Peter and I hitched our wagons young. Early 20s. He was wildly handsome, gay, with soulful brown eyes and a head full of loose, unruly curls. Raised by an African American woman and a white preacher man, Peter spent his childhood steeped in the evangelical ministry. He was as terrified of his father’s sermons as he was soothed by his mother’s inclination to administer to the more human aspects of the congregation they both led. The night I met Peter, he and I fell all the way in love. Kismet, you could say. He made me laugh with his very first words. It was my first time at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, the premier debut joint for every performance poet trying to get onto the New York City poetry scene. I read my first piece on the open mic after the slam. Peter was among the first admirers to make his way through the applauding crowd to tell me I had simultaneously embodied the fury of his father and the vulnerability of his mother — and, as such, I was destined to be one of his true loves. “Only one of?” I asked. “Fate isn’t fixed,” he said, “The gods have to leave room for surprises!” By the time we met in the fall of 1997, Peter’s parents were long divorced. His father had left the church. And Peter was already exploring other truths to believe in. Poetry was his new religion. His poems were long, lyrical and lovingly painted with the impossibly beautiful brushstrokes of utopia. He lived his life with the same energy. He believed in the goodness of people. Once, in the middle of winter in Washington Square Park, I watched him unbutton his coat and drape it across the shoulders of a drunk who had just called him a homophobic slur. I was an ex-Christian and newly out lesbian fleeing the violent homophobia of the late 1990s in Jamaica, still wearing the fury of being attacked by a dozen boys and sexually assaulted in Kingston. I was ashamed and angry that it defined my final year of university. That’s why I moved to New York City on a tourist visa. I needed somewhere safe to call home. But I felt at sea in this new country. I had a few aunts and uncles in New York, but before any of this I had absolutely no relationship with my biological family. My parents had abandoned me — my mother at birth, and my father hadn’t even shown up. And now that I had announced that I was a lesbian, that already distant extended family wanted less to do with me. I was in New York in search of safety. Freedom. And room to explore my budding lesbian identity. I was seeking a tribe to which I could unequivocally belong. And the performance poetry slam scene was a mixture of every kind of misfit. Peter and I fit right in. In no time, it felt as if we had known each other our whole lives. We shared everything: stories, poems, disappointments, hopes. We spent most evenings together. I’d meet him after work and go to whichever cafe was holding a slam competition that night. He knew everything about me: how broke I was, who stole my favorite vibrator, the ex-cop who hit me — how I kept going back to her. Every time. One night, after a particularly bad fight with my abusive partner, my roommate cornered me and told me she was going to raise the rent unless I had sex with her. My tourist visa was almost expired. I had no money except what I won at the slams — and that was barely enough to pay for the couch, ramen noodles and a MetroCard. I had no work permit, so I couldn’t get a job. I couldn’t apply for any services. Without papers I couldn’t even get into a shelter. I told Peter I was going to give up on this crazy dream of freedom in New York to go back to Jamaica. He was quiet while I explained what it meant to be undocumented; I went on about green cards and citizenship and visas and immigration authorities. When I was done talking, he asked me to marry him. When I pushed back, saying such a marriage was illegal and that it might land us in trouble with the law, he said the law was wrong. “You love me, right?” I nodded. “Well, I love you. You love me. I want children. You want children, right?” “Right …” “Well, that is what people do when they love each other and they want to have children together. They get married. And that makes them a family. They can’t have it both ways. And love is love, right?” His argument was sound. If the rules were fair, I would have been able to marry a woman, get citizenship and start a family with her. As it stood in the U.S., that wasn’t allowed. But Peter and I were well within our right to claim the perks of being a couple. We were already partners. He was already my family. We were married at City Hall. Peter’s lover, who was to be our witness, didn’t even show up for the wedding. We had to ask a beautiful man in cowboy boots and a sequined vest to stand in for him. After our very giggly “I dos,” Peter invited me to Thanksgiving dinner with his family. Before the month was out, I moved in with him and his amazing mother, Carole Linda, in the beautiful old house, the one that was once his parents’ church, two blocks from the beach in Far Rockaway. We spent three magical years living together. No one understood the quirky, kooky couple who arrived together, left together, but flirted with everyone in between. We had so much fun together. We were the perfect couple. We knew we’d be the perfect parents. But we were a modern couple. We wanted to be more intentional, more deliberate about our choices than our parents had been. We had more living to do before we took on the responsibilities of children. We didn’t have money, but we had lots of time. We were committed to living first. But at 29 Peter was diagnosed with cancer. Stage 4. He was diagnosed in May. He died on Dec. 16. At 11:30. Half-hour before he would turn 30. I was so furious at him dying, I couldn’t cry. It felt as if all my dreams of family died with him; a partner, children, my willing comrade in the radical redefining of the modern family, modern love. His mother was better at making peace with the heavens over the loss of her firstborn. I was surprised at her ability to remain connected to me. She stayed close, calling, sending Christmas cards, checking in, even as I remained distant, angry, unsure about deserving the magic of the family Peter had so tragically, suddenly, left behind. I grudgingly remained connected to his younger brother, CJ, who reminded me so much of Peter. Except he wasn’t gay, or a poet. He grew up to be a fine filmmaker and the only straight man in the L.G.B.T.Q. alliance in college. We often called each other to reminisce about Peter, to recount the sorcery of him, to bask in the shared memory of his magic. Later, when I became frantic with the desire to start a family — chasing gay men at house parties, begging sperm from strangers on planes — I broke down and wept for what felt like the too-early death of my husband. I didn’t want to be the strange young widow hosting lesbian parties in Crown Heights. I wanted to be the badass lesbian writer, with the flamboyant gay husband, raising four children in a rambling old house that used to be a church, two blocks from the beach in Far Rockaway. In one conversation with CJ, he interrupted to ask if there was a way he could stand in for Peter, by giving me his sperm. A year later, my daughter, Zuri, the most astounding miracle, born a decade after Peter’s death, refers to Peter as her “almost dad.” Carole Linda is still my mother-in-law and my kid’s actual, biological grandmother. Zuri’s “Baba,” CJ, got married last August. Zuri almost passed out from the joy of being asked to be the ring bearer at the wedding. We all traveled from multiple cities to watch them speak the vows. His brothers, their wives, Peter’s grandmother, his father, me, my non-monogamous partner and a beautiful cohort of ordinary folks, misfits, artists, preachers, writers, activists, gay, straight, nonbinary. I looked around the room, thinking if we had had the choice, this is what Peter’s and my wedding would have looked like. Peter would have reveled in it. Some days I still hear Peter’s voice inside my head, rustling in the fall wind, booming in the rush of traffic on the West Side Highway. He’s always whispering, screaming, saying the same thing, “Fate isn’t fixed, Staceyann. There is always some room for the gods to surprise us.”'],\n",
       " 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/style/modern-love-confidence-self-love.html': ['This essay is part of a collaborative project with Black History, Continued. We invited readers and renowned writers to respond to the question “What is Black love today?” I’ve spent my whole life looking for similarities between myself and the protagonists in love stories. When I lost my father to prison and my mother’s attention to her double duties as a single parent, I escaped through books in an attempt to reimagine what love could look like. But the couples, usually locked in an embrace on the cover of those “harmless” rags, looked nothing like the people in my house. Abuse ruined the bones of our homes and turned them into rotten structures. My hopes of experiencing romance in the future seemed incompatible with my reality. I had no example of romantic love, not for girls that looked like me, until my cousin, Tiffany. Two years older than me, and seemingly in control of her life, Tiffany became a blueprint; no, a mirror — a way to see myself clearly. She was everything I wanted to be. She garnered attention when she walked into a room: ash brown hair, freckles and a genuine smile. Tiffany was beyond cool, she was fresh; beyond fresh, she was fly; beyond fly, her energy was unmatched. My cousin was my protector, the way an older sister should be. Tiffany taught me love by listening. She let me read her books and sing her songs from my favorite musicals. She joined me at my softball games and would sit next to me on the bench when I played catcher. She gave me tips for getting my crushes’ attention (none of which worked). First place in the oratory contest, she cheered. Solo during choir performance, she tossed a thumbs-up sign from the pew. We were inseparable until she went to high school and left me to fend for myself in those unimaginable middle school bouts of self-doubt. At 15, Tiffany had her first child. A little girl with a light as remarkable as her own, and the temperament of a doe. When she was pregnant, I asked her, “Are you sure?” She smiled and rubbed her belly. And just like that, my purpose was clear: I would have a daughter, too. Tiffany’s Little Light studied everything. Her mouth was an overturned cup spilling sunshine. They were an emerging constellation when they walked into a room together, stars to anybody who drew breath. They became a part of my vision board for maternal love. Do not be fooled, I too received this kind of love from my own mother. But it was so far removed from my teenage psyche, it wasn’t something I could pluck from my memory easily. You know, the way mirrors neglect to reflect what we’ve been conditioned to disbelieve. Despite the judgment of her being too young to raise a baby, Tiffany glowed. She glowed so brightly one could even say it blinded the jealous. And when Tiffany had her third child, she moved from California to find her footing in Baton Rouge. Her relationship with the father of her children, who I would later learn became more obsessed with the idea of owning Tiffany than loving her, was a wake-up call: Love is not transactional. Love is not ownership. Love is simply an act of absolute care. While love is an active verb, sometimes it ain’t enough at all. At 21, I had my daughter with my high school sweetheart. At 23, I left the dissolving relationship for a life that could hold my dreams to secure a future for my daughter. I called Tiffany to tell her the news. She answered, and I could hear her three children playing in the background. Little Light was now the eldest and took her job as protector of her two younger brothers seriously. “Cousin, are you sure?” Tiffany asked me. “Aren’t you scared?” I laughed away whatever fear I was carrying and told her I would be back. That it was just for the summer. But Tiffany knew what I couldn’t see yet. That I would find writing and become the woman of my own dreams. I cloaked myself in Tiffany’s charm and wore it until it became a second skin. This is how I arrived in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. I only dated men who called me beautiful. I flirted with anyone who could hold an interesting conversation. I gave love a run for its money because the only thing that truly kept my attention was my daughter’s health and laughter, and my burgeoning career in writing. I carried this new me everywhere: New York City, Poland, Britain and Canada. When the summer became a year, and the year became a decade, I recognized so much of my cousin in the way I carried myself. I loved how I looked to myself in the mirror. I loved how I looked from the reflection in my daughter’s eyes. Like Tiffany, I began to move through rooms easy like the wind, soundless and certain. This feeling stayed with me, from the red steps of our grandparents’ home in West Oakland to the Bed-Stuy stoops that became my sanctuary. At first, before she had her fifth child, Tiffany and I checked in weekly, then monthly, after she had her seventh child. Phone calls became text messages as our lives busied. She was raising eight children on her own and re-establishing herself after finally leaving an abusive relationship. Every other year I would visit, and when I couldn’t be physically present, I sent supportive messages, care packages and invitations for her to visit me on tour. After 15 years of visits dictated by holiday breaks and family reunions, I invited Tiffany to Florida. Tiffany had never been and was on a break from her on-again off-again relationship. I wanted to protect her. I wanted her to see what the world had to offer. She was the very best part of me. She gave me courage. She gave me reassurance. She gave me pep talks. She gave me compliments. Loving and celebrating others was natural for Tiffany. The least I could do was repay her generosity by giving her the space she needed to figure out who she wanted to be. Through Tiffany’s turbulent relationships, and her absolute love for her children, I began to understand what love costs. When she met me in Miami, a place I traveled to for weekends and took for granted, her eyes welled up with tears. I asked, “What’s wrong, cousin?” By the time she could pull herself together, we were walking alongside the beach, our manicured toes leaving kiss-prints on the sand. “I never thought I would get to see the Atlantic Ocean,” she said, tears sliding down her freckled face. “I feel like all I have is my kids. I’ve never traveled and seen the world like you.” I held my breath, terrified by the weight of the moment, but ready to rise to the occasion and remind her what she taught me so many years before. Fairy tales might teach us stories of whimsy, designed to mold single Black women into roles of grateful service before they’ve ever seen the world. It was my turn to show Tiffany that we are in fact an entire world ourselves.'],\n",
       " 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/style/modern-love-black-boyfriend-applications.html': ['This essay is part of a collaborative project with Black History, Continued. We invited readers and renowned writers to respond to the question “What is Black love today?” “I am no longer dating white guys. Nonwhite guys may submit their applications in my DMs.” These words, posted on my Facebook page, marked the beginning of a racial reckoning in my dating life. Some context: It was June 2020. George Floyd had just been murdered. Black people like myself were consumed with rage and were openly airing our grief. On top of that, I was a woman scorned. I was 35 years old, a highly educated Black woman, a homeowner and an attorney, and I had just been rejected by yet another mediocre white guy who then pursued a relationship with a white woman. In short, I was fed up with white people. So one afternoon, I wrote a half-crazed manifesto on my Facebook page. Specifically, I railed against a white society that clearly didn’t see me as white but insisted on rejecting my Blackness because of my appearance (fair-skinned) and upbringing (middle class). White people had called me “not Black” for liking Taylor Swift, told me they were “more Black than me” because they grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood (or had an especially dark tan), and fetishized my “exoticness” and ethnic ambiguity. I ended my ramblings with the call for applicants. I clicked “post” without thinking. To my amazement, the likes and comments started pouring in. Black people saying that they’d had similar experiences. White allies thanking me and promising to “do the work.” I felt so vindicated. And then this popped up on Facebook Messenger: “Application submitted!” The message was from Josh, whom I went to high school with 18 years earlier in Maryland. He was tall, handsome, smart, funny and successful. And Black. I’d briefly reconnected with him at a bar in Baltimore in 2018 when I was in town for a work conference. We had flirted, but I remembered from Facebook that he’d gotten married, so I flew back to California at the end of the conference with a wistful “what-if” feeling fluttering in my chest. I soon found out through mutual friends that his marriage had ended before we connected, but seeing as we lived 3,000 miles apart, I figured there was no point in trying to pursue anything. But here he was now, reading my manifesto and submitting an actual application to date me. I was gobsmacked. Up to that point, the vast majority of my relationships had been with white men, the predictable result of years spent in a Maryland prep school and at a Massachusetts liberal arts college. In fact, it had become a running joke among my friends and family: If the guy was basic and white, he was my type. But I had never, not once, dated a Black man. And I’ll be honest — I had always felt a kind of shame around that, as though my not dating Black men reflected a deep-seated insecurity with my own Blackness. But here was an eligible Black bachelor offering me a chance at love, and a chance at embracing my Blackness. Josh and I started texting. We had a couple of video calls that were awkward at first but became more natural. I suggested flying out to Baltimore to see him, and he agreed. On the one hand, it seemed wild and reckless, jumping on a plane to visit someone I barely knew. And during a pandemic to boot. On the other, the whole thing felt like something out of a movie. I was flying 3,000 miles to have our “first date.” We packed a lot into that four-day first date. He took me to Baltimore’s National Aquarium. He treated me to dinners and wine. He even took me to a (socially distanced) visit with my grandmother on her birthday. Most of all, we reveled in our Blackness. We danced to hip-hop in his living room — and he could dance, something I had rarely experienced with my white boyfriends. We joked about the endearing quirks of our older Black relatives. We shared stories about being among the few Black people in our respective professional arenas — finance for him; law for me. With him I could openly “speak the language” and not have to explain myself. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could be completely, unapologetically Black with the guy I was dating. Like most first dates, there were uncomfortable moments. Josh was reserved and rarely volunteered information about himself, which meant it was hard to get to know him. And while there was definitely a mutual physical attraction, there was a shyness in Josh that only seemed to fall away with the help of a few drinks. Still, I chalked that up to our still getting to know one another. However, on my last night there, as we gazed at the city lights over the Inner Harbor, he turned to me and said, “You know this isn’t going to work, right?” Completely out of nowhere. I asked him to explain. He said our personalities were too different — I’m outgoing, high-energy and emotional; he’s analytical, quiet and calm. I, both a romantic and a lawyer, attempted to argue my case — “Doesn’t love find a way?” — and he, the realistic, number-crunching one, pointed out the obvious practical hurdles. With the physical distance between us, there was no way to properly date or figure out how we would fit together. My fairy tale seemingly shattered, I started to cry. He seemed sad too, though whether it was because of a mutual feeling of despair or simply uneasiness at my tears, I couldn’t tell. The next morning he drove me to the airport and I asked him to visit me in California. He gave a noncommittal answer. I left wondering if I would ever see him again. Turns out, I would. A few weeks after my Maryland trip, Josh asked to visit me in California. I was thrilled. I convinced myself that he wanted to visit California to see if he could make a home here with me. I planned a day trip to Napa. I borrowed my neighbor’s bike for Josh so we could tool around town together in true Californian style. I proudly showed him off to my friends, took him to my favorite local haunts, and tried my hardest to prove how great we could be together, the perfect Black power couple. Still, we weren’t quite clicking. Josh wasn’t entirely on board with my carefree Cali style. When we biked to the river on a hot day, I eagerly stripped down to splash around in the cool water, but he refused. When we strolled the sidewalks of downtown Napa, I reached out to intertwine my fingers with his, and he shook my hand off — turns out he wasn’t a fan of P.D.A. And the reservedness I had witnessed in Baltimore persisted. I tried to ask him questions about his family, of whom he seldom spoke. He demurred: “That’s personal.” As someone who had always been an open book, I was frustrated. When I drove him to the airport at the end of the visit, I had a hollow feeling. Why weren’t we clicking when we were perfect for each other, at least on paper: same hometown, same education, same career-driven lives, and most importantly (or so I thought), same race? How was this not kismet? It all came to a head in the spring of 2021. Josh invited me to Baltimore for the Preakness, an annual horse race and social event. But a disagreement over a coffee maker before I arrived — he didn’t own one, and for reasons I couldn’t fathom, didn’t want to have one on hand for my visits — pushed me over the edge. I said, “If you can’t even keep a coffee maker for me, it’s obvious you don’t care enough for me to fly 3,000 miles to see you.” To my horror, he didn’t argue. I said I wasn’t coming, and he didn’t try to change my mind. And that was it. What the hell had just happened? How did my lofty dreams fall so flat? Did I really fly to Maryland, and him to California — during a pandemic — for nothing more than a booty call? Over time, I realized my attachment to Josh was more intellectual than emotional. I had tried to make him — kind and well-meaning, but unable to match my spirit or provide me the emotional connection I wanted — into my perfect boyfriend, because he was Black. Josh represented the first time I naïvely attached my worth as a Black person to the success of my relationship with a Black man. But dating a Black man will not make me more Black, just as dating a white man won’t make me less Black. I am Black, period.  Regardless of the race or ethnicity of my next boyfriend, at least I’ll know one thing: Whoever loves me next must love all of me.']}"

       "      <td>Two days before I left South Dakota, Rex and I sat talking beneath the open hatchback of my car. In the distance, a lightning storm moved toward us over the open expanse of the Great Plains, churning the sky a murky purple. He was talking passionately about lithium batteries. The more he talked, the less he and I seemed to have in common. I considered myself someone who could become interested in almost anything, especially when I was attracted to the person speaking. But now I asked myself: Did I care about batteries? He and I were volunteers on the Pine Ridge Reservation, building and repairing infrastructure. He had been the first person to greet me when I arrived at the end of the long, dirt road. When he climbed out of the cab of a skid loader, and I saw his face, my body warmed. In the lyrical version of what happened as the storm approached, we would have stopped talking and taken seriously the pleasure of our bodies. But wanting to have a baby had made dating in my late 30s less like a poem and more like a math problem. There was a lot that had to line up, and what I was looking for now differed from what my younger self had envisioned. I didn’t care about dating someone for a certain amount of time before we had a baby, or being in love, or getting married. I wanted to like the biological father of my child, maybe admire him. That was about it. I had arrived at this set of criteria because the alternatives seemed sentimental and unrealistic, especially the husband-to-be wish lists that many of us champion during those years when we are both ready and able to have children. With the help of my sitting meditation practice, I had observed that the more I worried about getting pregnant, the less discerning I was about love, an effect I feared would intensify as I got older. How could I trust my judgment under pressure? Wouldn’t a lot of men start to smell like fathers? I decided the safest way to protect myself against romantic delusion would be to separate the two stories from the outset: I could try to find a mate or become a mother, but not at the same time. Since biological constraints made it easy to figure out which was more urgent, I resolved to have a child outside of the context of love. My solo road trip to South Dakota was conceived as an experience my future self, the one saddled with a dependent, would someday thank me for. When I returned home, I planned to get pregnant using an anonymous donor’s sperm. On my last evening with Rex, kissing in his tent, I realized there was a lot about him I didn’t know — who was in his life, where he worked, his last name. Before I crawled out of his tent, he asked for my phone number. He was headed home to Michigan, and I to California. I told him I thought we should leave things exactly as they were, which seemed perfect to me. “What, are you crazy?” he said, and he gave me his number. Back home, I pored over donor questionnaires at the local sperm bank, trying to keep straight who liked video games and who preferred billiards, but it all mixed blandly together for me. Phone conversations with Rex, though, were weird and memorable. He had inherited his father’s expressions such as “Son of a biscuit!” and “Jeez O’Pete’s!” Doting on his backyard laying hens, he often referred to himself as a “chicken mama.” He was the only 30-something adult I knew who had traveled on an airplane exactly once, a domestic round trip for a former job. We didn’t talk much about the parts of our lives that existed beyond the present. He mentioned that his relationship with a woman in Michigan was crumbling. All he knew of my path to motherhood was that I wanted a child. When my search for a donor stagnated from lacking a warm feeling about any of them, friends offered to screen profiles with me on the eve of my 40th birthday. Two donors received my friends’ approval, so I put myself on the wait-list for their sperm, though I still felt ambivalent. When I finally told Rex about my stalled plan to become a mother, he said, “I can help you with that.” I was silent. Then I said, “Don’t say something like that without thinking about it.” “I have.” He wasn’t interested in being a father or co-parent, so the scenarios we discussed assumed that by the time I gave birth, he and I no longer would be romantically involved. Soon he visited me in California and had his first experience soaking naked with strangers in hot springs, his first contact with thousand-year-old redwood trees (he cried). He gave back rubs that were accurate, not clumsy; his hands were full of life. We were still working on our donor arrangement. We were also falling in love. I went to stay with him in Michigan, where he taught me how to use a chain saw and care for chickens. Eventually, he followed me back to California, driving the whole way towing a homemade trailer filled with tools. During this time, we were trying to live two separate stories: the one in which every month we tried to conceive, and the other in which we were still getting to know each other. But the more we enjoyed ourselves, the more confusing our situation became. If I got pregnant, would he leave the relationship? If I didn’t get pregnant, would I switch to another donor? About a year after he offered to be my donor, we began to have these difficult conversations. And in the middle of them, I got pregnant. Such was his generosity that he was genuinely thrilled for me. Inwardly, though, he began to withdraw. He still didn’t want to be a father or co-parent; the thought of either brought up old wounds from his childhood. Every day of his indecision, I was tempted to try to convince him to stay. Most days, I had enough sanity to recognize that doing this would harm us both. On the day he left California, he took a photograph of me looking haunted. Then he got in his car and drove east. It was Father’s Day. After he left, I scrambled into action, interviewing midwives, searching online for used baby gear, and trying to explain to the being in my womb why I was crying a lot: “I’m sorry, baby. I’m OK, just sad.” Then weeks later, without warning, a text arrived: “I made a terrible mistake.” By then, I recognized he wasn’t the only one. When love and a baby coincided for me, I still believed I could separate the two and remain fundamentally unchanged. Not until Rex and I were suffering was I able to see that the clean reality I envisioned had never existed between us. It had evaporated the moment he greeted me at the end of the dirt road, and my body responded with warmth. Buddhism is founded on the truth that suffering is caused by desire, which at first glance can make both suffering and desire sound unequivocally bad. But the beauty of suffering is that it offers the opportunity to have a curious and tender relationship with desire, to listen to it rather than try to eradicate it. Often what I hear beneath my desire’s surface noise isn’t problematic, only human: the vulnerability in having a life tangled up with others. In Rex’s absence, I remembered that tending to a lover or child is dirty work, in the most wholesome sense. We don’t fall in love or have a baby to have our points of view and preferences affirmed. We do it, at least a little bit, to soften our singular, lonesome grip on reality and invite in the unexpected, the undesirable and the inexplicable. This — call it messiness, or richness, or hands full of life — is what is beautiful and natural about being an animal with appetites beyond our understanding. Being faithful in the deepest sense to a lover or baby is saying yes to the weird and memorable before you know you want it or welcome it. Rex came to this in his own way. He told me that since he left California, he had been listening to podcasts about fatherhood and looking at the photo of me he took the day he left. He’d been crying, too. And he wanted to come back. “To the baby?” I said. “Or to me?” “Both,” he said. And he did. He sold his heaviest tools, repainted walls and put his house in Michigan up for sale. And two months later, he was back in California in time to catch in his hands our son being born.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My husband and I married in a Presbyterian church in Watkins Glen, N.Y., on the banks of Seneca Lake. It was June 2006, three months before he started seminary and five-and-a-half years after I had quit the sex industry. I considered our wedding the marriage of the former stripper and the future minister. After the wedding, I followed the contours of his career with the flexibility and accord of a synchronized swimmer. I left my job at a Vermont newspaper and moved to Boston, where he had enrolled in theological school. While he studied, I read books that told me how to read The Book, how to live The Book. To cross the Jordan, I read, we must die, symbolically. We must give ourselves up, let go and be embodied by Christ. I let go of all my friends, gave up my Blues music (too sexy) and Celtic music (too many mentions of whiskey) and my tight iridescent clothes. My sex toys and handcuffs dropped straight into the garbage. The furniture I had owned was expunged from our lives, the wood buckling on the back porch before we tossed each piece into the trash. Purged of my former life, I started over, guided by this 22-year-old man, seven years younger than I, who was making Jesus his business. He thought he was saving me, and I thought I needed to be saved. In my experience, sex work and Christianity were not incongruous. I only danced for a few months, in San Francisco and New York, to make my rent payments between college and my job as a web developer, but the shame and guilt I felt about stripping pivoted neatly to my role as a good Christian wife. In both cases, I relied on the perceptions of others to define my value. Our first baby was born in the winter, and the next summer we lived at a Baptist summer camp where my husband was employed as the waterfront director. Each day I traversed the camp with the baby in a jogging stroller, juddering down the rocky path to the lake where my husband stood on a dock all day watching the water. After dinner he jumped inside an octagonal pen and played gaga ball with 11-year-old boys while I retreated to our room to nurse the baby because I was not allowed to breastfeed in front of campers. In the evenings, staff gave testimonies of their Christian journeys and led singalongs, campfires and talent shows. By the time my husband came to bed, the baby and I were asleep. When we woke at 7 a.m., he was gone. I read the Bible that summer, Genesis to Revelation. I memorized scriptures. One night I came to the chapel where my husband was preaching to campers and heard him lecture from Leviticus Chapter 11. It is OK, he said, to eat crickets and grasshoppers, but not flies. Locusts are an acceptable snack, but shrimp are forbidden. If you pick up a dead pig, you must wash your clothes. The campers were rapt, and I thought, “He is brilliant, the way he relates the Bible to children.” I didn’t tell anyone I was terrified the Christian community would reject me if they knew I used to be a stripper. My husband told me his career depended on our collective reputation. The camp director’s wife ate meals at our table. She was stout with a round face and creases under her eyes, and she was accessible, meaning she acknowledged that I existed and greeted me in a grumpy but cheerful way. “If I give a testimony,” I asked her, “how much of my story am I supposed to share?” My testimony, I had gathered, was the story of my Christian journey, with answers to these questions: When was I baptized? When did I give my life to Christ? When did I accept Jesus as my Lord and savior? I was baptized as a baby and again with my husband, full immersion, fully clothed, a month after our daughter was born. I had given my life to Christ at the Mission Church in Somerville, Mass., two years earlier. Did the testimony also include the question: When did you conclude there must be a light to lead us out of this dense darkness? When did you feel so wrong you decided to turn around, to repent? Was it in the basement of the Paradise Club, when a man yanked you down and groped you? The camp director’s wife rolled her eyes and said, “Well, that’s up to you to decide.” My full testimony, I thought, might have a shock value similar to the story a man from the kitchen staff told to the new campers about putting a gun to his head and hearing a voice say, “I love you.” I wondered what kind of shocks they were willing to accept. Did they believe strippers could be saved? Some jobs are water, and some are wine. Some evaporate without a trace, and some leave a stain. The Bible studies were segregated by gender, so I went to the women’s Bible study and told them that I was lonely, that I needed a mentor or someone I could talk to about my spiritual path. They listened with wide eyes, then closed them and prayed that I would find someone. By “someone,” they meant someone else. In the lonely vertigo, I found Jesus. Every morning, I sneaked into the back of the log chapel, raised my hand in the air and sang love songs to Jesus. I stood in the last pew, separated from the campers, bouncing my baby if she was awake or, if she was asleep in the reclined stroller, praying that the praise would not wake her. Along with the girls and boys in tie-dyed T-shirts and shaggy hair, I sang quietly over an electronic accompaniment, “Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.” It worked. The eyes of my heart opened, and they wept. My heart ached, and all of it — the isolation, the anonymity, the worry, the pain of seeing but never being seen as I pushed the stroller from road to forest to road, swatting horse flies that dived at my head, even the shock that this life had settled over me like a blanket and smothered my spark — all of it I attributed to Jesus. I was sad because I had sinned. I was lonely because I was cut off from God. Every morning I stood at the back of the chapel and sang, “Here I am to worship,” one hand reaching for the stained glass. If I could humble myself enough to take Jesus into my heart, to die to this world and be reborn as a pure, sinless ray of light, the resurrected me would be a gossamer membrane illuminated like a lantern whose radiance is uneclipsed by an immolated moth carcass. If I could submit to Jesus, maybe I could submit to my husband, like the Bible recommends. I tried so hard to be good. Quieting the babies at night so he could sleep soundly before his exams. Smiling politely when a man would say, “Behind every great man is a great woman,” instead of asking why they stand right in front of us. I felt invisible. From the hyper exposure of bare skin on a spot-lit stage, I had repented and repackaged myself as a pastor’s wife. The pendulum had swung from one extreme to another, and neither felt authentic. I don’t know how the Christian community at the camp would have reacted to my brief stint as a stripper because I never gave a testimony. My fear of them pre-empted their judgment of me. I never allowed them the opportunity to accept me. Stripping is not inherently shameful; by thinking in polarities of good and bad, I ascribed it with shame. In both extremes, I felt incomplete, preferring to categorize my behavior as all bad or all good. I looked to my husband to be my “other half.” When I felt naughty, he seemed holy. When I thought of myself as virtuous, I only saw his faults. The marriage lasted 15 years. As a divorced mother, I have relaxed into my body and learned to see through my own eyes — to look, not to look like; to be, not to pose. I no longer adjust myself according to my reflection in others’ eyes. My body has changed since I danced in clubs more than two decades ago. Birthing four children has stretched my belly from a six-pack to a boule of unbaked bread. It is a mother’s body. It is my body, to embrace and be embraced with love.

       "      <td>This essay is part of a collaborative project with Black History, Continued. We invited readers and renowned writers to respond to the question “What is Black love today?” Peter and I hitched our wagons young. Early 20s. He was wildly handsome, gay, with soulful brown eyes and a head full of loose, unruly curls. Raised by an African American woman and a white preacher man, Peter spent his childhood steeped in the evangelical ministry. He was as terrified of his father’s sermons as he was soothed by his mother’s inclination to administer to the more human aspects of the congregation they both led. The night I met Peter, he and I fell all the way in love. Kismet, you could say. He made me laugh with his very first words. It was my first time at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, the premier debut joint for every performance poet trying to get onto the New York City poetry scene. I read my first piece on the open mic after the slam. Peter was among the first admirers to make his way through the applauding crowd to tell me I had simultaneously embodied the fury of his father and the vulnerability of his mother — and, as such, I was destined to be one of his true loves. “Only one of?” I asked. “Fate isn’t fixed,” he said, “The gods have to leave room for surprises!” By the time we met in the fall of 1997, Peter’s parents were long divorced. His father had left the church. And Peter was already exploring other truths to believe in. Poetry was his new religion. His poems were long, lyrical and lovingly painted with the impossibly beautiful brushstrokes of utopia. He lived his life with the same energy. He believed in the goodness of people. Once, in the middle of winter in Washington Square Park, I watched him unbutton his coat and drape it across the shoulders of a drunk who had just called him a homophobic slur. I was an ex-Christian and newly out lesbian fleeing the violent homophobia of the late 1990s in Jamaica, still wearing the fury of being attacked by a dozen boys and sexually assaulted in Kingston. I was ashamed and angry that it defined my final year of university. That’s why I moved to New York City on a tourist visa. I needed somewhere safe to call home. But I felt at sea in this new country. I had a few aunts and uncles in New York, but before any of this I had absolutely no relationship with my biological family. My parents had abandoned me — my mother at birth, and my father hadn’t even shown up. And now that I had announced that I was a lesbian, that already distant extended family wanted less to do with me. I was in New York in search of safety. Freedom. And room to explore my budding lesbian identity. I was seeking a tribe to which I could unequivocally belong. And the performance poetry slam scene was a mixture of every kind of misfit. Peter and I fit right in. In no time, it felt as if we had known each other our whole lives. We shared everything: stories, poems, disappointments, hopes. We spent most evenings together. I’d meet him after work and go to whichever cafe was holding a slam competition that night. He knew everything about me: how broke I was, who stole my favorite vibrator, the ex-cop who hit me — how I kept going back to her. Every time. One night, after a particularly bad fight with my abusive partner, my roommate cornered me and told me she was going to raise the rent unless I had sex with her. My tourist visa was almost expired. I had no money except what I won at the slams — and that was barely enough to pay for the couch, ramen noodles and a MetroCard. I had no work permit, so I couldn’t get a job. I couldn’t apply for any services. Without papers I couldn’t even get into a shelter. I told Peter I was going to give up on this crazy dream of freedom in New York to go back to Jamaica. He was quiet while I explained what it meant to be undocumented; I went on about green cards and citizenship and visas and immigration authorities. When I was done talking, he asked me to marry him. When I pushed back, saying such a marriage was illegal and that it might land us in trouble with the law, he said the law was wrong. “You love me, right?” I nodded. “Well, I love you. You love me. I want children. You want children, right?” “Right …” “Well, that is what people do when they love each other and they want to have children together. They get married. And that makes them a family. They can’t have it both ways. And love is love, right?” His argument was sound. If the rules were fair, I would have been able to marry a woman, get citizenship and start a family with her. As it stood in the U.S., that wasn’t allowed. But Peter and I were well within our right to claim the perks of being a couple. We were already partners. He was already my family. We were married at City Hall. Peter’s lover, who was to be our witness, didn’t even show up for the wedding. We had to ask a beautiful man in cowboy boots and a sequined vest to stand in for him. After our very giggly “I dos,” Peter invited me to Thanksgiving dinner with his family. Before the month was out, I moved in with him and his amazing mother, Carole Linda, in the beautiful old house, the one that was once his parents’ church, two blocks from the beach in Far Rockaway. We spent three magical years living together. No one understood the quirky, kooky couple who arrived together, left together, but flirted with everyone in between. We had so much fun together. We were the perfect couple. We knew we’d be the perfect parents. But we were a modern couple. We wanted to be more intentional, more deliberate about our choices than our parents had been. We had more living to do before we took on the responsibilities of children. We didn’t have money, but we had lots of time. We were committed to living first. But at 29 Peter was diagnosed with cancer. Stage 4. He was diagnosed in May. He died on Dec. 16. At 11:30. Half-hour before he would turn 30. I was so furious at him dying, I couldn’t cry. It felt as if all my dreams of family died with him; a partner, children, my willing comrade in the radical redefining of the modern family, modern love. His mother was better at making peace with the heavens over the loss of her firstborn. I was surprised at her ability to remain connected to me. She stayed close, calling, sending Christmas cards, checking in, even as I remained distant, angry, unsure about deserving the magic of the family Peter had so tragically, suddenly, left behind. I grudgingly remained connected to his younger brother, CJ, who reminded me so much of Peter. Except he wasn’t gay, or a poet. He grew up to be a fine filmmaker and the only straight man in the L.G.B.T.Q. alliance in college. We often called each other to reminisce about Peter, to recount the sorcery of him, to bask in the shared memory of his magic. Later, when I became frantic with the desire to start a family — chasing gay men at house parties, begging sperm from strangers on planes — I broke down and wept for what felt like the too-early death of my husband. I didn’t want to be the strange young widow hosting lesbian parties in Crown Heights. I wanted to be the badass lesbian writer, with the flamboyant gay husband, raising four children in a rambling old house that used to be a church, two blocks from the beach in Far Rockaway. In one conversation with CJ, he interrupted to ask if there was a way he could stand in for Peter, by giving me his sperm. A year later, my daughter, Zuri, the most astounding miracle, born a decade after Peter’s death, refers to Peter as her “almost dad.” Carole Linda is still my mother-in-law and my kid’s actual, biological grandmother. Zuri’s “Baba,” CJ, got married last August. Zuri almost passed out from the joy of being asked to be the ring bearer at the wedding. We all traveled from multiple cities to watch them speak the vows. His brothers, their wives, Peter’s grandmother, his father, me, my non-monogamous partner and a beautiful cohort of ordinary folks, misfits, artists, preachers, writers, activists, gay, straight, nonbinary. I looked around the room, thinking if we had had the choice, this is what Peter’s and my wedding would have looked like. Peter would have reveled in it. Some days I still hear Peter’s voice inside my head, rustling in the fall wind, booming in the rush of traffic on the West Side Highway. He’s always whispering, screaming, saying the same thing, “Fate isn’t fixed, Staceyann. There is always some room for the gods to surprise us.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>This essay is part of a collaborative project with Black History, Continued. We invited readers and renowned writers to respond to the question “What is Black love today?” I’ve spent my whole life looking for similarities between myself and the protagonists in love stories. When I lost my father to prison and my mother’s attention to her double duties as a single parent, I escaped through books in an attempt to reimagine what love could look like. But the couples, usually locked in an embrace on the cover of those “harmless” rags, looked nothing like the people in my house. Abuse ruined the bones of our homes and turned them into rotten structures. My hopes of experiencing romance in the future seemed incompatible with my reality. I had no example of romantic love, not for girls that looked like me, until my cousin, Tiffany. Two years older than me, and seemingly in control of her life, Tiffany became a blueprint; no, a mirror — a way to see myself clearly. She was everything I wanted to be. She garnered attention when she walked into a room: ash brown hair, freckles and a genuine smile. Tiffany was beyond cool, she was fresh; beyond fresh, she was fly; beyond fly, her energy was unmatched. My cousin was my protector, the way an older sister should be. Tiffany taught me love by listening. She let me read her books and sing her songs from my favorite musicals. She joined me at my softball games and would sit next to me on the bench when I played catcher. She gave me tips for getting my crushes’ attention (none of which worked). First place in the oratory contest, she cheered. Solo during choir performance, she tossed a thumbs-up sign from the pew. We were inseparable until she went to high school and left me to fend for myself in those unimaginable middle school bouts of self-doubt. At 15, Tiffany had her first child. A little girl with a light as remarkable as her own, and the temperament of a doe. When she was pregnant, I asked her, “Are you sure?” She smiled and rubbed her belly. And just like that, my purpose was clear: I would have a daughter, too. Tiffany’s Little Light studied everything. Her mouth was an overturned cup spilling sunshine. They were an emerging constellation when they walked into a room together, stars to anybody who drew breath. They became a part of my vision board for maternal love. Do not be fooled, I too received this kind of love from my own mother. But it was so far removed from my teenage psyche, it wasn’t something I could pluck from my memory easily. You know, the way mirrors neglect to reflect what we’ve been conditioned to disbelieve. Despite the judgment of her being too young to raise a baby, Tiffany glowed. She glowed so brightly one could even say it blinded the jealous. And when Tiffany had her third child, she moved from California to find her footing in Baton Rouge. Her relationship with the father of her children, who I would later learn became more obsessed with the idea of owning Tiffany than loving her, was a wake-up call: Love is not transactional. Love is not ownership. Love is simply an act of absolute care. While love is an active verb, sometimes it ain’t enough at all. At 21, I had my daughter with my high school sweetheart. At 23, I left the dissolving relationship for a life that could hold my dreams to secure a future for my daughter. I called Tiffany to tell her the news. She answered, and I could hear her three children playing in the background. Little Light was now the eldest and took her job as protector of her two younger brothers seriously. “Cousin, are you sure?” Tiffany asked me. “Aren’t you scared?” I laughed away whatever fear I was carrying and told her I would be back. That it was just for the summer. But Tiffany knew what I couldn’t see yet. That I would find writing and become the woman of my own dreams. I cloaked myself in Tiffany’s charm and wore it until it became a second skin. This is how I arrived in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. I only dated men who called me beautiful. I flirted with anyone who could hold an interesting conversation. I gave love a run for its money because the only thing that truly kept my attention was my daughter’s health and laughter, and my burgeoning career in writing. I carried this new me everywhere: New York City, Poland, Britain and Canada. When the summer became a year, and the year became a decade, I recognized so much of my cousin in the way I carried myself. I loved how I looked to myself in the mirror. I loved how I looked from the reflection in my daughter’s eyes. Like Tiffany, I began to move through rooms easy like the wind, soundless and certain. This feeling stayed with me, from the red steps of our grandparents’ home in West Oakland to the Bed-Stuy stoops that became my sanctuary. At first, before she had her fifth child, Tiffany and I checked in weekly, then monthly, after she had her seventh child. Phone calls became text messages as our lives busied. She was raising eight children on her own and re-establishing herself after finally leaving an abusive relationship. Every other year I would visit, and when I couldn’t be physically present, I sent supportive messages, care packages and invitations for her to visit me on tour. After 15 years of visits dictated by holiday breaks and family reunions, I invited Tiffany to Florida. Tiffany had never been and was on a break from her on-again off-again relationship. I wanted to protect her. I wanted her to see what the world had to offer. She was the very best part of me. She gave me courage. She gave me reassurance. She gave me pep talks. She gave me compliments. Loving and celebrating others was natural for Tiffany. The least I could do was repay her generosity by giving her the space she needed to figure out who she wanted to be. Through Tiffany’s turbulent relationships, and her absolute love for her children, I began to understand what love costs. When she met me in Miami, a place I traveled to for weekends and took for granted, her eyes welled up with tears. I asked, “What’s wrong, cousin?” By the time she could pull herself together, we were walking alongside the beach, our manicured toes leaving kiss-prints on the sand. “I never thought I would get to see the Atlantic Ocean,” she said, tears sliding down her freckled face. “I feel like all I have is my kids. I’ve never traveled and seen the world like you.” I held my breath, terrified by the weight of the moment, but ready to rise to the occasion and remind her what she taught me so many years before. Fairy tales might teach us stories of whimsy, designed to mold single Black women into roles of grateful service before they’ve ever seen the world. It was my turn to show Tiffany that we are in fact an entire world ourselves.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This essay is part of a collaborative project with Black History, Continued. We invited readers and renowned writers to respond to the question “What is Black love today?” “I am no longer dating white guys. Nonwhite guys may submit their applications in my DMs.” These words, posted on my Facebook page, marked the beginning of a racial reckoning in my dating life. Some context: It was June 2020. George Floyd had just been murdered. Black people like myself were consumed with rage and were openly airing our grief. On top of that, I was a woman scorned. I was 35 years old, a highly educated Black woman, a homeowner and an attorney, and I had just been rejected by yet another mediocre white guy who then pursued a relationship with a white woman. In short, I was fed up with white people. So one afternoon, I wrote a half-crazed manifesto on my Facebook page. Specifically, I railed against a white society that clearly didn’t see me as white but insisted on rejecting my Blackness because of my appearance (fair-skinned) and upbringing (middle class). White people had called me “not Black” for liking Taylor Swift, told me they were “more Black than me” because they grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood (or had an especially dark tan), and fetishized my “exoticness” and ethnic ambiguity. I ended my ramblings with the call for applicants. I clicked “post” without thinking. To my amazement, the likes and comments started pouring in. Black people saying that they’d had similar experiences. White allies thanking me and promising to “do the work.” I felt so vindicated. And then this popped up on Facebook Messenger: “Application submitted!” The message was from Josh, whom I went to high school with 18 years earlier in Maryland. He was tall, handsome, smart, funny and successful. And Black. I’d briefly reconnected with him at a bar in Baltimore in 2018 when I was in town for a work conference. We had flirted, but I remembered from Facebook that he’d gotten married, so I flew back to California at the end of the conference with a wistful “what-if” feeling fluttering in my chest. I soon found out through mutual friends that his marriage had ended before we connected, but seeing as we lived 3,000 miles apart, I figured there was no point in trying to pursue anything. But here he was now, reading my manifesto and submitting an actual application to date me. I was gobsmacked. Up to that point, the vast majority of my relationships had been with white men, the predictable result of years spent in a Maryland prep school and at a Massachusetts liberal arts college. In fact, it had become a running joke among my friends and family: If the guy was basic and white, he was my type. But I had never, not once, dated a Black man. And I’ll be honest — I had always felt a kind of shame around that, as though my not dating Black men reflected a deep-seated insecurity with my own Blackness. But here was an eligible Black bachelor offering me a chance at love, and a chance at embracing my Blackness. Josh and I started texting. We had a couple of video calls that were awkward at first but became more natural. I suggested flying out to Baltimore to see him, and he agreed. On the one hand, it seemed wild and reckless, jumping on a plane to visit someone I barely knew. And during a pandemic to boot. On the other, the whole thing felt like something out of a movie. I was flying 3,000 miles to have our “first date.” We packed a lot into that four-day first date. He took me to Baltimore’s National Aquarium. He treated me to dinners and wine. He even took me to a (socially distanced) visit with my grandmother on her birthday. Most of all, we reveled in our Blackness. We danced to hip-hop in his living room — and he could dance, something I had rarely experienced with my white boyfriends. We joked about the endearing quirks of our older Black relatives. We shared stories about being among the few Black people in our respective professional arenas — finance for him; law for me. With him I could openly “speak the language” and not have to explain myself. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could be completely, unapologetically Black with the guy I was dating. Like most first dates, there were uncomfortable moments. Josh was reserved and rarely volunteered information about himself, which meant it was hard to get to know him. And while there was definitely a mutual physical attraction, there was a shyness in Josh that only seemed to fall away with the help of a few drinks. Still, I chalked that up to our still getting to know one another. However, on my last night there, as we gazed at the city lights over the Inner Harbor, he turned to me and said, “You know this isn’t going to work, right?” Completely out of nowhere. I asked him to explain. He said our personalities were too different — I’m outgoing, high-energy and emotional; he’s analytical, quiet and calm. I, both a romantic and a lawyer, attempted to argue my case — “Doesn’t love find a way?” — and he, the realistic, number-crunching one, pointed out the obvious practical hurdles. With the physical distance between us, there was no way to properly date or figure out how we would fit together. My fairy tale seemingly shattered, I started to cry. He seemed sad too, though whether it was because of a mutual feeling of despair or simply uneasiness at my tears, I couldn’t tell. The next morning he drove me to the airport and I asked him to visit me in California. He gave a noncommittal answer. I left wondering if I would ever see him again. Turns out, I would. A few weeks after my Maryland trip, Josh asked to visit me in California. I was thrilled. I convinced myself that he wanted to visit California to see if he could make a home here with me. I planned a day trip to Napa. I borrowed my neighbor’s bike for Josh so we could tool around town together in true Californian style. I proudly showed him off to my friends, took him to my favorite local haunts, and tried my hardest to prove how great we could be together, the perfect Black power couple. Still, we weren’t quite clicking. Josh wasn’t entirely on board with my carefree Cali style. When we biked to the river on a hot day, I eagerly stripped down to splash around in the cool water, but he refused. When we strolled the sidewalks of downtown Napa, I reached out to intertwine my fingers with his, and he shook my hand off — turns out he wasn’t a fan of P.D.A. And the reservedness I had witnessed in Baltimore persisted. I tried to ask him questions about his family, of whom he seldom spoke. He demurred: “That’s personal.” As someone who had always been an open book, I was frustrated. When I drove him to the airport at the end of the visit, I had a hollow feeling. Why weren’t we clicking when we were perfect for each other, at least on paper: same hometown, same education, same career-driven lives, and most importantly (or so I thought), same race? How was this not kismet? It all came to a head in the spring of 2021. Josh invited me to Baltimore for the Preakness, an annual horse race and social event. But a disagreement over a coffee maker before I arrived — he didn’t own one, and for reasons I couldn’t fathom, didn’t want to have one on hand for my visits — pushed me over the edge. I said, “If you can’t even keep a coffee maker for me, it’s obvious you don’t care enough for me to fly 3,000 miles to see you.” To my horror, he didn’t argue. I said I wasn’t coming, and he didn’t try to change my mind. And that was it. What the hell had just happened? How did my lofty dreams fall so flat? Did I really fly to Maryland, and him to California — during a pandemic — for nothing more than a booty call? Over time, I realized my attachment to Josh was more intellectual than emotional. I had tried to make him — kind and well-meaning, but unable to match my spirit or provide me the emotional connection I wanted — into my perfect boyfriend, because he was Black. Josh represented the first time I naïvely attached my worth as a Black person to the success of my relationship with a Black man. But dating a Black man will not make me more Black, just as dating a white man won’t make me less Black. I am Black, period.  Regardless of the race or ethnicity of my next boyfriend, at least I’ll know one thing: Whoever loves me next must love all of me.</td>\n",

       "0  Two days before I left South Dakota, Rex and I sat talking beneath the open hatchback of my car. In the distance, a lightning storm moved toward us over the open expanse of the Great Plains, churning the sky a murky purple. He was talking passionately about lithium batteries. The more he talked, the less he and I seemed to have in common. I considered myself someone who could become interested in almost anything, especially when I was attracted to the person speaking. But now I asked myself: Did I care about batteries? He and I were volunteers on the Pine Ridge Reservation, building and repairing infrastructure. He had been the first person to greet me when I arrived at the end of the long, dirt road. When he climbed out of the cab of a skid loader, and I saw his face, my body warmed. In the lyrical version of what happened as the storm approached, we would have stopped talking and taken seriously the pleasure of our bodies. But wanting to have a baby had made dating in my late 30s less like a poem and more like a math problem. There was a lot that had to line up, and what I was looking for now differed from what my younger self had envisioned. I didn’t care about dating someone for a certain amount of time before we had a baby, or being in love, or getting married. I wanted to like the biological father of my child, maybe admire him. That was about it. I had arrived at this set of criteria because the alternatives seemed sentimental and unrealistic, especially the husband-to-be wish lists that many of us champion during those years when we are both ready and able to have children. With the help of my sitting meditation practice, I had observed that the more I worried about getting pregnant, the less discerning I was about love, an effect I feared would intensify as I got older. How could I trust my judgment under pressure? Wouldn’t a lot of men start to smell like fathers? I decided the safest way to protect myself against romantic delusion would be to separate the two stories from the outset: I could try to find a mate or become a mother, but not at the same time. Since biological constraints made it easy to figure out which was more urgent, I resolved to have a child outside of the context of love. My solo road trip to South Dakota was conceived as an experience my future self, the one saddled with a dependent, would someday thank me for. When I returned home, I planned to get pregnant using an anonymous donor’s sperm. On my last evening with Rex, kissing in his tent, I realized there was a lot about him I didn’t know — who was in his life, where he worked, his last name. Before I crawled out of his tent, he asked for my phone number. He was headed home to Michigan, and I to California. I told him I thought we should leave things exactly as they were, which seemed perfect to me. “What, are you crazy?” he said, and he gave me his number. Back home, I pored over donor questionnaires at the local sperm bank, trying to keep straight who liked video games and who preferred billiards, but it all mixed blandly together for me. Phone conversations with Rex, though, were weird and memorable. He had inherited his father’s expressions such as “Son of a biscuit!” and “Jeez O’Pete’s!” Doting on his backyard laying hens, he often referred to himself as a “chicken mama.” He was the only 30-something adult I knew who had traveled on an airplane exactly once, a domestic round trip for a former job. We didn’t talk much about the parts of our lives that existed beyond the present. He mentioned that his relationship with a woman in Michigan was crumbling. All he knew of my path to motherhood was that I wanted a child. When my search for a donor stagnated from lacking a warm feeling about any of them, friends offered to screen profiles with me on the eve of my 40th birthday. Two donors received my friends’ approval, so I put myself on the wait-list for their sperm, though I still felt ambivalent. When I finally told Rex about my stalled plan to become a mother, he said, “I can help you with that.” I was silent. Then I said, “Don’t say something like that without thinking about it.” “I have.” He wasn’t interested in being a father or co-parent, so the scenarios we discussed assumed that by the time I gave birth, he and I no longer would be romantically involved. Soon he visited me in California and had his first experience soaking naked with strangers in hot springs, his first contact with thousand-year-old redwood trees (he cried). He gave back rubs that were accurate, not clumsy; his hands were full of life. We were still working on our donor arrangement. We were also falling in love. I went to stay with him in Michigan, where he taught me how to use a chain saw and care for chickens. Eventually, he followed me back to California, driving the whole way towing a homemade trailer filled with tools. During this time, we were trying to live two separate stories: the one in which every month we tried to conceive, and the other in which we were still getting to know each other. But the more we enjoyed ourselves, the more confusing our situation became. If I got pregnant, would he leave the relationship? If I didn’t get pregnant, would I switch to another donor? About a year after he offered to be my donor, we began to have these difficult conversations. And in the middle of them, I got pregnant. Such was his generosity that he was genuinely thrilled for me. Inwardly, though, he began to withdraw. He still didn’t want to be a father or co-parent; the thought of either brought up old wounds from his childhood. Every day of his indecision, I was tempted to try to convince him to stay. Most days, I had enough sanity to recognize that doing this would harm us both. On the day he left California, he took a photograph of me looking haunted. Then he got in his car and drove east. It was Father’s Day. After he left, I scrambled into action, interviewing midwives, searching online for used baby gear, and trying to explain to the being in my womb why I was crying a lot: “I’m sorry, baby. I’m OK, just sad.” Then weeks later, without warning, a text arrived: “I made a terrible mistake.” By then, I recognized he wasn’t the only one. When love and a baby coincided for me, I still believed I could separate the two and remain fundamentally unchanged. Not until Rex and I were suffering was I able to see that the clean reality I envisioned had never existed between us. It had evaporated the moment he greeted me at the end of the dirt road, and my body responded with warmth. Buddhism is founded on the truth that suffering is caused by desire, which at first glance can make both suffering and desire sound unequivocally bad. But the beauty of suffering is that it offers the opportunity to have a curious and tender relationship with desire, to listen to it rather than try to eradicate it. Often what I hear beneath my desire’s surface noise isn’t problematic, only human: the vulnerability in having a life tangled up with others. In Rex’s absence, I remembered that tending to a lover or child is dirty work, in the most wholesome sense. We don’t fall in love or have a baby to have our points of view and preferences affirmed. We do it, at least a little bit, to soften our singular, lonesome grip on reality and invite in the unexpected, the undesirable and the inexplicable. This — call it messiness, or richness, or hands full of life — is what is beautiful and natural about being an animal with appetites beyond our understanding. Being faithful in the deepest sense to a lover or baby is saying yes to the weird and memorable before you know you want it or welcome it. Rex came to this in his own way. He told me that since he left California, he had been listening to podcasts about fatherhood and looking at the photo of me he took the day he left. He’d been crying, too. And he wanted to come back. “To the baby?” I said. “Or to me?” “Both,” he said. And he did. He sold his heaviest tools, repainted walls and put his house in Michigan up for sale. And two months later, he was back in California in time to catch in his hands our son being born.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1  My husband and I married in a Presbyterian church in Watkins Glen, N.Y., on the banks of Seneca Lake. It was June 2006, three months before he started seminary and five-and-a-half years after I had quit the sex industry. I considered our wedding the marriage of the former stripper and the future minister. After the wedding, I followed the contours of his career with the flexibility and accord of a synchronized swimmer. I left my job at a Vermont newspaper and moved to Boston, where he had enrolled in theological school. While he studied, I read books that told me how to read The Book, how to live The Book. To cross the Jordan, I read, we must die, symbolically. We must give ourselves up, let go and be embodied by Christ. I let go of all my friends, gave up my Blues music (too sexy) and Celtic music (too many mentions of whiskey) and my tight iridescent clothes. My sex toys and handcuffs dropped straight into the garbage. The furniture I had owned was expunged from our lives, the wood buckling on the back porch before we tossed each piece into the trash. Purged of my former life, I started over, guided by this 22-year-old man, seven years younger than I, who was making Jesus his business. He thought he was saving me, and I thought I needed to be saved. In my experience, sex work and Christianity were not incongruous. I only danced for a few months, in San Francisco and New York, to make my rent payments between college and my job as a web developer, but the shame and guilt I felt about stripping pivoted neatly to my role as a good Christian wife. In both cases, I relied on the perceptions of others to define my value. Our first baby was born in the winter, and the next summer we lived at a Baptist summer camp where my husband was employed as the waterfront director. Each day I traversed the camp with the baby in a jogging stroller, juddering down the rocky path to the lake where my husband stood on a dock all day watching the water. After dinner he jumped inside an octagonal pen and played gaga ball with 11-year-old boys while I retreated to our room to nurse the baby because I was not allowed to breastfeed in front of campers. In the evenings, staff gave testimonies of their Christian journeys and led singalongs, campfires and talent shows. By the time my husband came to bed, the baby and I were asleep. When we woke at 7 a.m., he was gone. I read the Bible that summer, Genesis to Revelation. I memorized scriptures. One night I came to the chapel where my husband was preaching to campers and heard him lecture from Leviticus Chapter 11. It is OK, he said, to eat crickets and grasshoppers, but not flies. Locusts are an acceptable snack, but shrimp are forbidden. If you pick up a dead pig, you must wash your clothes. The campers were rapt, and I thought, “He is brilliant, the way he relates the Bible to children.” I didn’t tell anyone I was terrified the Christian community would reject me if they knew I used to be a stripper. My husband told me his career depended on our collective reputation. The camp director’s wife ate meals at our table. She was stout with a round face and creases under her eyes, and she was accessible, meaning she acknowledged that I existed and greeted me in a grumpy but cheerful way. “If I give a testimony,” I asked her, “how much of my story am I supposed to share?” My testimony, I had gathered, was the story of my Christian journey, with answers to these questions: When was I baptized? When did I give my life to Christ? When did I accept Jesus as my Lord and savior? I was baptized as a baby and again with my husband, full immersion, fully clothed, a month after our daughter was born. I had given my life to Christ at the Mission Church in Somerville, Mass., two years earlier. Did the testimony also include the question: When did you conclude there must be a light to lead us out of this dense darkness? When did you feel so wrong you decided to turn around, to repent? Was it in the basement of the Paradise Club, when a man yanked you down and groped you? The camp director’s wife rolled her eyes and said, “Well, that’s up to you to decide.” My full testimony, I thought, might have a shock value similar to the story a man from the kitchen staff told to the new campers about putting a gun to his head and hearing a voice say, “I love you.” I wondered what kind of shocks they were willing to accept. Did they believe strippers could be saved? Some jobs are water, and some are wine. Some evaporate without a trace, and some leave a stain. The Bible studies were segregated by gender, so I went to the women’s Bible study and told them that I was lonely, that I needed a mentor or someone I could talk to about my spiritual path. They listened with wide eyes, then closed them and prayed that I would find someone. By “someone,” they meant someone else. In the lonely vertigo, I found Jesus. Every morning, I sneaked into the back of the log chapel, raised my hand in the air and sang love songs to Jesus. I stood in the last pew, separated from the campers, bouncing my baby if she was awake or, if she was asleep in the reclined stroller, praying that the praise would not wake her. Along with the girls and boys in tie-dyed T-shirts and shaggy hair, I sang quietly over an electronic accompaniment, “Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.” It worked. The eyes of my heart opened, and they wept. My heart ached, and all of it — the isolation, the anonymity, the worry, the pain of seeing but never being seen as I pushed the stroller from road to forest to road, swatting horse flies that dived at my head, even the shock that this life had settled over me like a blanket and smothered my spark — all of it I attributed to Jesus. I was sad because I had sinned. I was lonely because I was cut off from God. Every morning I stood at the back of the chapel and sang, “Here I am to worship,” one hand reaching for the stained glass. If I could humble myself enough to take Jesus into my heart, to die to this world and be reborn as a pure, sinless ray of light, the resurrected me would be a gossamer membrane illuminated like a lantern whose radiance is uneclipsed by an immolated moth carcass. If I could submit to Jesus, maybe I could submit to my husband, like the Bible recommends. I tried so hard to be good. Quieting the babies at night so he could sleep soundly before his exams. Smiling politely when a man would say, “Behind every great man is a great woman,” instead of asking why they stand right in front of us. I felt invisible. From the hyper exposure of bare skin on a spot-lit stage, I had repented and repackaged myself as a pastor’s wife. The pendulum had swung from one extreme to another, and neither felt authentic. I don’t know how the Christian community at the camp would have reacted to my brief stint as a stripper because I never gave a testimony. My fear of them pre-empted their judgment of me. I never allowed them the opportunity to accept me. Stripping is not inherently shameful; by thinking in polarities of good and bad, I ascribed it with shame. In both extremes, I felt incomplete, preferring to categorize my behavior as all bad or all good. I looked to my husband to be my “other half.” When I felt naughty, he seemed holy. When I thought of myself as virtuous, I only saw his faults. The marriage lasted 15 years. As a divorced mother, I have relaxed into my body and learned to see through my own eyes — to look, not to look like; to be, not to pose. I no longer adjust myself according to my reflection in others’ eyes. My body has changed since I danced in clubs more than two decades ago. Birthing four children has stretched my belly from a six-pack to a boule of unbaked bread. It is a mother’s body. It is my body, to embrace and be embraced with love.

       "2  This essay is part of a collaborative project with Black History, Continued. We invited readers and renowned writers to respond to the question “What is Black love today?” Peter and I hitched our wagons young. Early 20s. He was wildly handsome, gay, with soulful brown eyes and a head full of loose, unruly curls. Raised by an African American woman and a white preacher man, Peter spent his childhood steeped in the evangelical ministry. He was as terrified of his father’s sermons as he was soothed by his mother’s inclination to administer to the more human aspects of the congregation they both led. The night I met Peter, he and I fell all the way in love. Kismet, you could say. He made me laugh with his very first words. It was my first time at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, the premier debut joint for every performance poet trying to get onto the New York City poetry scene. I read my first piece on the open mic after the slam. Peter was among the first admirers to make his way through the applauding crowd to tell me I had simultaneously embodied the fury of his father and the vulnerability of his mother — and, as such, I was destined to be one of his true loves. “Only one of?” I asked. “Fate isn’t fixed,” he said, “The gods have to leave room for surprises!” By the time we met in the fall of 1997, Peter’s parents were long divorced. His father had left the church. And Peter was already exploring other truths to believe in. Poetry was his new religion. His poems were long, lyrical and lovingly painted with the impossibly beautiful brushstrokes of utopia. He lived his life with the same energy. He believed in the goodness of people. Once, in the middle of winter in Washington Square Park, I watched him unbutton his coat and drape it across the shoulders of a drunk who had just called him a homophobic slur. I was an ex-Christian and newly out lesbian fleeing the violent homophobia of the late 1990s in Jamaica, still wearing the fury of being attacked by a dozen boys and sexually assaulted in Kingston. I was ashamed and angry that it defined my final year of university. That’s why I moved to New York City on a tourist visa. I needed somewhere safe to call home. But I felt at sea in this new country. I had a few aunts and uncles in New York, but before any of this I had absolutely no relationship with my biological family. My parents had abandoned me — my mother at birth, and my father hadn’t even shown up. And now that I had announced that I was a lesbian, that already distant extended family wanted less to do with me. I was in New York in search of safety. Freedom. And room to explore my budding lesbian identity. I was seeking a tribe to which I could unequivocally belong. And the performance poetry slam scene was a mixture of every kind of misfit. Peter and I fit right in. In no time, it felt as if we had known each other our whole lives. We shared everything: stories, poems, disappointments, hopes. We spent most evenings together. I’d meet him after work and go to whichever cafe was holding a slam competition that night. He knew everything about me: how broke I was, who stole my favorite vibrator, the ex-cop who hit me — how I kept going back to her. Every time. One night, after a particularly bad fight with my abusive partner, my roommate cornered me and told me she was going to raise the rent unless I had sex with her. My tourist visa was almost expired. I had no money except what I won at the slams — and that was barely enough to pay for the couch, ramen noodles and a MetroCard. I had no work permit, so I couldn’t get a job. I couldn’t apply for any services. Without papers I couldn’t even get into a shelter. I told Peter I was going to give up on this crazy dream of freedom in New York to go back to Jamaica. He was quiet while I explained what it meant to be undocumented; I went on about green cards and citizenship and visas and immigration authorities. When I was done talking, he asked me to marry him. When I pushed back, saying such a marriage was illegal and that it might land us in trouble with the law, he said the law was wrong. “You love me, right?” I nodded. “Well, I love you. You love me. I want children. You want children, right?” “Right …” “Well, that is what people do when they love each other and they want to have children together. They get married. And that makes them a family. They can’t have it both ways. And love is love, right?” His argument was sound. If the rules were fair, I would have been able to marry a woman, get citizenship and start a family with her. As it stood in the U.S., that wasn’t allowed. But Peter and I were well within our right to claim the perks of being a couple. We were already partners. He was already my family. We were married at City Hall. Peter’s lover, who was to be our witness, didn’t even show up for the wedding. We had to ask a beautiful man in cowboy boots and a sequined vest to stand in for him. After our very giggly “I dos,” Peter invited me to Thanksgiving dinner with his family. Before the month was out, I moved in with him and his amazing mother, Carole Linda, in the beautiful old house, the one that was once his parents’ church, two blocks from the beach in Far Rockaway. We spent three magical years living together. No one understood the quirky, kooky couple who arrived together, left together, but flirted with everyone in between. We had so much fun together. We were the perfect couple. We knew we’d be the perfect parents. But we were a modern couple. We wanted to be more intentional, more deliberate about our choices than our parents had been. We had more living to do before we took on the responsibilities of children. We didn’t have money, but we had lots of time. We were committed to living first. But at 29 Peter was diagnosed with cancer. Stage 4. He was diagnosed in May. He died on Dec. 16. At 11:30. Half-hour before he would turn 30. I was so furious at him dying, I couldn’t cry. It felt as if all my dreams of family died with him; a partner, children, my willing comrade in the radical redefining of the modern family, modern love. His mother was better at making peace with the heavens over the loss of her firstborn. I was surprised at her ability to remain connected to me. She stayed close, calling, sending Christmas cards, checking in, even as I remained distant, angry, unsure about deserving the magic of the family Peter had so tragically, suddenly, left behind. I grudgingly remained connected to his younger brother, CJ, who reminded me so much of Peter. Except he wasn’t gay, or a poet. He grew up to be a fine filmmaker and the only straight man in the L.G.B.T.Q. alliance in college. We often called each other to reminisce about Peter, to recount the sorcery of him, to bask in the shared memory of his magic. Later, when I became frantic with the desire to start a family — chasing gay men at house parties, begging sperm from strangers on planes — I broke down and wept for what felt like the too-early death of my husband. I didn’t want to be the strange young widow hosting lesbian parties in Crown Heights. I wanted to be the badass lesbian writer, with the flamboyant gay husband, raising four children in a rambling old house that used to be a church, two blocks from the beach in Far Rockaway. In one conversation with CJ, he interrupted to ask if there was a way he could stand in for Peter, by giving me his sperm. A year later, my daughter, Zuri, the most astounding miracle, born a decade after Peter’s death, refers to Peter as her “almost dad.” Carole Linda is still my mother-in-law and my kid’s actual, biological grandmother. Zuri’s “Baba,” CJ, got married last August. Zuri almost passed out from the joy of being asked to be the ring bearer at the wedding. We all traveled from multiple cities to watch them speak the vows. His brothers, their wives, Peter’s grandmother, his father, me, my non-monogamous partner and a beautiful cohort of ordinary folks, misfits, artists, preachers, writers, activists, gay, straight, nonbinary. I looked around the room, thinking if we had had the choice, this is what Peter’s and my wedding would have looked like. Peter would have reveled in it. Some days I still hear Peter’s voice inside my head, rustling in the fall wind, booming in the rush of traffic on the West Side Highway. He’s always whispering, screaming, saying the same thing, “Fate isn’t fixed, Staceyann. There is always some room for the gods to surprise us.”  \n",
       "3  This essay is part of a collaborative project with Black History, Continued. We invited readers and renowned writers to respond to the question “What is Black love today?” I’ve spent my whole life looking for similarities between myself and the protagonists in love stories. When I lost my father to prison and my mother’s attention to her double duties as a single parent, I escaped through books in an attempt to reimagine what love could look like. But the couples, usually locked in an embrace on the cover of those “harmless” rags, looked nothing like the people in my house. Abuse ruined the bones of our homes and turned them into rotten structures. My hopes of experiencing romance in the future seemed incompatible with my reality. I had no example of romantic love, not for girls that looked like me, until my cousin, Tiffany. Two years older than me, and seemingly in control of her life, Tiffany became a blueprint; no, a mirror — a way to see myself clearly. She was everything I wanted to be. She garnered attention when she walked into a room: ash brown hair, freckles and a genuine smile. Tiffany was beyond cool, she was fresh; beyond fresh, she was fly; beyond fly, her energy was unmatched. My cousin was my protector, the way an older sister should be. Tiffany taught me love by listening. She let me read her books and sing her songs from my favorite musicals. She joined me at my softball games and would sit next to me on the bench when I played catcher. She gave me tips for getting my crushes’ attention (none of which worked). First place in the oratory contest, she cheered. Solo during choir performance, she tossed a thumbs-up sign from the pew. We were inseparable until she went to high school and left me to fend for myself in those unimaginable middle school bouts of self-doubt. At 15, Tiffany had her first child. A little girl with a light as remarkable as her own, and the temperament of a doe. When she was pregnant, I asked her, “Are you sure?” She smiled and rubbed her belly. And just like that, my purpose was clear: I would have a daughter, too. Tiffany’s Little Light studied everything. Her mouth was an overturned cup spilling sunshine. They were an emerging constellation when they walked into a room together, stars to anybody who drew breath. They became a part of my vision board for maternal love. Do not be fooled, I too received this kind of love from my own mother. But it was so far removed from my teenage psyche, it wasn’t something I could pluck from my memory easily. You know, the way mirrors neglect to reflect what we’ve been conditioned to disbelieve. Despite the judgment of her being too young to raise a baby, Tiffany glowed. She glowed so brightly one could even say it blinded the jealous. And when Tiffany had her third child, she moved from California to find her footing in Baton Rouge. Her relationship with the father of her children, who I would later learn became more obsessed with the idea of owning Tiffany than loving her, was a wake-up call: Love is not transactional. Love is not ownership. Love is simply an act of absolute care. While love is an active verb, sometimes it ain’t enough at all. At 21, I had my daughter with my high school sweetheart. At 23, I left the dissolving relationship for a life that could hold my dreams to secure a future for my daughter. I called Tiffany to tell her the news. She answered, and I could hear her three children playing in the background. Little Light was now the eldest and took her job as protector of her two younger brothers seriously. “Cousin, are you sure?” Tiffany asked me. “Aren’t you scared?” I laughed away whatever fear I was carrying and told her I would be back. That it was just for the summer. But Tiffany knew what I couldn’t see yet. That I would find writing and become the woman of my own dreams. I cloaked myself in Tiffany’s charm and wore it until it became a second skin. This is how I arrived in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. I only dated men who called me beautiful. I flirted with anyone who could hold an interesting conversation. I gave love a run for its money because the only thing that truly kept my attention was my daughter’s health and laughter, and my burgeoning career in writing. I carried this new me everywhere: New York City, Poland, Britain and Canada. When the summer became a year, and the year became a decade, I recognized so much of my cousin in the way I carried myself. I loved how I looked to myself in the mirror. I loved how I looked from the reflection in my daughter’s eyes. Like Tiffany, I began to move through rooms easy like the wind, soundless and certain. This feeling stayed with me, from the red steps of our grandparents’ home in West Oakland to the Bed-Stuy stoops that became my sanctuary. At first, before she had her fifth child, Tiffany and I checked in weekly, then monthly, after she had her seventh child. Phone calls became text messages as our lives busied. She was raising eight children on her own and re-establishing herself after finally leaving an abusive relationship. Every other year I would visit, and when I couldn’t be physically present, I sent supportive messages, care packages and invitations for her to visit me on tour. After 15 years of visits dictated by holiday breaks and family reunions, I invited Tiffany to Florida. Tiffany had never been and was on a break from her on-again off-again relationship. I wanted to protect her. I wanted her to see what the world had to offer. She was the very best part of me. She gave me courage. She gave me reassurance. She gave me pep talks. She gave me compliments. Loving and celebrating others was natural for Tiffany. The least I could do was repay her generosity by giving her the space she needed to figure out who she wanted to be. Through Tiffany’s turbulent relationships, and her absolute love for her children, I began to understand what love costs. When she met me in Miami, a place I traveled to for weekends and took for granted, her eyes welled up with tears. I asked, “What’s wrong, cousin?” By the time she could pull herself together, we were walking alongside the beach, our manicured toes leaving kiss-prints on the sand. “I never thought I would get to see the Atlantic Ocean,” she said, tears sliding down her freckled face. “I feel like all I have is my kids. I’ve never traveled and seen the world like you.” I held my breath, terrified by the weight of the moment, but ready to rise to the occasion and remind her what she taught me so many years before. Fairy tales might teach us stories of whimsy, designed to mold single Black women into roles of grateful service before they’ve ever seen the world. It was my turn to show Tiffany that we are in fact an entire world ourselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "4  This essay is part of a collaborative project with Black History, Continued. We invited readers and renowned writers to respond to the question “What is Black love today?” “I am no longer dating white guys. Nonwhite guys may submit their applications in my DMs.” These words, posted on my Facebook page, marked the beginning of a racial reckoning in my dating life. Some context: It was June 2020. George Floyd had just been murdered. Black people like myself were consumed with rage and were openly airing our grief. On top of that, I was a woman scorned. I was 35 years old, a highly educated Black woman, a homeowner and an attorney, and I had just been rejected by yet another mediocre white guy who then pursued a relationship with a white woman. In short, I was fed up with white people. So one afternoon, I wrote a half-crazed manifesto on my Facebook page. Specifically, I railed against a white society that clearly didn’t see me as white but insisted on rejecting my Blackness because of my appearance (fair-skinned) and upbringing (middle class). White people had called me “not Black” for liking Taylor Swift, told me they were “more Black than me” because they grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood (or had an especially dark tan), and fetishized my “exoticness” and ethnic ambiguity. I ended my ramblings with the call for applicants. I clicked “post” without thinking. To my amazement, the likes and comments started pouring in. Black people saying that they’d had similar experiences. White allies thanking me and promising to “do the work.” I felt so vindicated. And then this popped up on Facebook Messenger: “Application submitted!” The message was from Josh, whom I went to high school with 18 years earlier in Maryland. He was tall, handsome, smart, funny and successful. And Black. I’d briefly reconnected with him at a bar in Baltimore in 2018 when I was in town for a work conference. We had flirted, but I remembered from Facebook that he’d gotten married, so I flew back to California at the end of the conference with a wistful “what-if” feeling fluttering in my chest. I soon found out through mutual friends that his marriage had ended before we connected, but seeing as we lived 3,000 miles apart, I figured there was no point in trying to pursue anything. But here he was now, reading my manifesto and submitting an actual application to date me. I was gobsmacked. Up to that point, the vast majority of my relationships had been with white men, the predictable result of years spent in a Maryland prep school and at a Massachusetts liberal arts college. In fact, it had become a running joke among my friends and family: If the guy was basic and white, he was my type. But I had never, not once, dated a Black man. And I’ll be honest — I had always felt a kind of shame around that, as though my not dating Black men reflected a deep-seated insecurity with my own Blackness. But here was an eligible Black bachelor offering me a chance at love, and a chance at embracing my Blackness. Josh and I started texting. We had a couple of video calls that were awkward at first but became more natural. I suggested flying out to Baltimore to see him, and he agreed. On the one hand, it seemed wild and reckless, jumping on a plane to visit someone I barely knew. And during a pandemic to boot. On the other, the whole thing felt like something out of a movie. I was flying 3,000 miles to have our “first date.” We packed a lot into that four-day first date. He took me to Baltimore’s National Aquarium. He treated me to dinners and wine. He even took me to a (socially distanced) visit with my grandmother on her birthday. Most of all, we reveled in our Blackness. We danced to hip-hop in his living room — and he could dance, something I had rarely experienced with my white boyfriends. We joked about the endearing quirks of our older Black relatives. We shared stories about being among the few Black people in our respective professional arenas — finance for him; law for me. With him I could openly “speak the language” and not have to explain myself. For the first time in my life, I felt like I could be completely, unapologetically Black with the guy I was dating. Like most first dates, there were uncomfortable moments. Josh was reserved and rarely volunteered information about himself, which meant it was hard to get to know him. And while there was definitely a mutual physical attraction, there was a shyness in Josh that only seemed to fall away with the help of a few drinks. Still, I chalked that up to our still getting to know one another. However, on my last night there, as we gazed at the city lights over the Inner Harbor, he turned to me and said, “You know this isn’t going to work, right?” Completely out of nowhere. I asked him to explain. He said our personalities were too different — I’m outgoing, high-energy and emotional; he’s analytical, quiet and calm. I, both a romantic and a lawyer, attempted to argue my case — “Doesn’t love find a way?” — and he, the realistic, number-crunching one, pointed out the obvious practical hurdles. With the physical distance between us, there was no way to properly date or figure out how we would fit together. My fairy tale seemingly shattered, I started to cry. He seemed sad too, though whether it was because of a mutual feeling of despair or simply uneasiness at my tears, I couldn’t tell. The next morning he drove me to the airport and I asked him to visit me in California. He gave a noncommittal answer. I left wondering if I would ever see him again. Turns out, I would. A few weeks after my Maryland trip, Josh asked to visit me in California. I was thrilled. I convinced myself that he wanted to visit California to see if he could make a home here with me. I planned a day trip to Napa. I borrowed my neighbor’s bike for Josh so we could tool around town together in true Californian style. I proudly showed him off to my friends, took him to my favorite local haunts, and tried my hardest to prove how great we could be together, the perfect Black power couple. Still, we weren’t quite clicking. Josh wasn’t entirely on board with my carefree Cali style. When we biked to the river on a hot day, I eagerly stripped down to splash around in the cool water, but he refused. When we strolled the sidewalks of downtown Napa, I reached out to intertwine my fingers with his, and he shook my hand off — turns out he wasn’t a fan of P.D.A. And the reservedness I had witnessed in Baltimore persisted. I tried to ask him questions about his family, of whom he seldom spoke. He demurred: “That’s personal.” As someone who had always been an open book, I was frustrated. When I drove him to the airport at the end of the visit, I had a hollow feeling. Why weren’t we clicking when we were perfect for each other, at least on paper: same hometown, same education, same career-driven lives, and most importantly (or so I thought), same race? How was this not kismet? It all came to a head in the spring of 2021. Josh invited me to Baltimore for the Preakness, an annual horse race and social event. But a disagreement over a coffee maker before I arrived — he didn’t own one, and for reasons I couldn’t fathom, didn’t want to have one on hand for my visits — pushed me over the edge. I said, “If you can’t even keep a coffee maker for me, it’s obvious you don’t care enough for me to fly 3,000 miles to see you.” To my horror, he didn’t argue. I said I wasn’t coming, and he didn’t try to change my mind. And that was it. What the hell had just happened? How did my lofty dreams fall so flat? Did I really fly to Maryland, and him to California — during a pandemic — for nothing more than a booty call? Over time, I realized my attachment to Josh was more intellectual than emotional. I had tried to make him — kind and well-meaning, but unable to match my spirit or provide me the emotional connection I wanted — into my perfect boyfriend, because he was Black. Josh represented the first time I naïvely attached my worth as a Black person to the success of my relationship with a Black man. But dating a Black man will not make me more Black, just as dating a white man won’t make me less Black. I am Black, period.  Regardless of the race or ethnicity of my next boyfriend, at least I’ll know one thing: Whoever loves me next must love all of me.

       "      <td>Her OkCupid profile mentioned that she was really good at Scrabble, so I sent her a message challenging her to a game of Words With Friends. “Loser buys the winner coffee,” I wrote. “You game?” She accepted but told me coffee wasn’t possible; she was in China for the school year teaching English and wouldn’t be back until July. It was now January. I had moved to Reno from Washington, D.C., six months earlier to take a job at the University of Nevada and was having trouble meeting people. Over those months, I had messaged more than 60 women and heard back from only six, leading to zero dates. So it seemed cruelly fitting that the first woman I really connected with had moved to China. But hey, a good Words With Friends partner can be even harder to find than love. Later that evening, she challenged me to a game, at 6 p.m. for me, 9 a.m. for her. An odd first date: half a world between us, sitting on my couch with phone in hand, looking for bingos and hoping to draw an “S” or a blank. Play a move, send a message. Repeat. We were evenly matched. I barely won our first game. Soon we were playing two games at once and chatting in both, two entirely different conversational threads — one serious and the other playful. We kept this up for six straight hours. At one point, I had to slide my couch closer to an outlet because my battery was at 2 percent. Like any good first date, I didn’t want it to end. We talked about everything from our childhood pets (her rats, Mr. Peepers and Tefnut, and my dog, Inky) to my fanciful dream of one day running a retirement home for animals: geriatric cows and octogenarian pigs happily living out their golden years with nothing whatsoever expected from them. She told me the worst gift she had ever given a boyfriend was a giant Hershey bar. I confessed that I’m more likely to cry during a movie trailer than while watching the actual movie. I told her I always botch clichés — “It’s not like it’s rocket surgery.” Falling asleep that night, happier than I’d felt in some time, I wondered if I was being catfished. Those six hours had been too good, the kind of night you dream about, and then suddenly the sun is rising. Ridiculous, flirtatious or serious — whatever the topic, it was always easy. The next night was no different, and I realized I had to start getting this down on paper. When a game ended, our chats from that game ended with it. Every 45 minutes or so, everything would disappear, and I wanted to preserve all of it, proof that such things are possible, and at any age. After a week, I told my best friend back East what was happening. She told me a story about a co-worker who had an online relationship with a woman for two years. Now they are married. I laughed it off and thanked her, but I told her I had no illusions. We were always brutally honest about our future, namely in agreeing there wasn’t one. It wasn’t even clear that she was coming back to Reno; she would go wherever she managed to land a job. We were a most pleasant distraction for each other, but school would eventually resume for her, and I’d eventually meet someone in Reno. On the Words With Friends board, we were both masters of the endgame, but there didn’t seem to be any endgame for us in real life. I also knew that it was the baked-in distance and the impossibility of a date that had allowed me to fall so deeply in the first place. In person, I’m typically so shy in romantic situations that I can barely make eye contact with someone I’ve just met. With her, I felt free to open myself up entirely. Two weeks in, after playing and chatting four to six hours every night, she warned me that she was meeting her father in South Korea the coming weekend and wouldn’t be around to keep up our nightly ritual. It’s strange to miss someone you have never actually met. In the morning, I awoke to a message she had sent from the airport, waiting out a delay. This single message meant more to me than the thousands of others we had exchanged. When I took my first business trip as a single man a few years earlier, I remember wishing I had someone to text from the airport. I had internalized the idea that love is having someone who cares about every utterly benign detail of your travel. “I made it!” I wanted to tap out. “Man, I think I parked in the furthest possible spot.” “The line at security is insane — is it spring break or something?” “Ok, at my gate!” “Boarding!” “Shutting down now, about to take off :).” All those imagined texts with no recipient. It stung even more when my plane touched down several hours later with nobody to tell I’d arrived safely. Our three days “apart” didn’t stall anything. After she returned, we slid right back into our routine of increasingly intimate disclosures. The times we each tried to rescue a hurt animal we came across. The worst thing I did as a kid that I still feel guilty about. Growing up in broken homes. Worst dating experience. Favorite sex position. Ever fake an orgasm? She agreed with me that the biggest commitment either of us could ever make would be combining our libraries, and that we probably shouldn’t take that step until we had at least two kids. One night, I told her my memory is extremely selective: I’ll remember she played the clarinet until sixth grade, yet consistently forget her birthday. It turned out that very day was her birthday. By that point, we had long stopped being surprised at the freakish number of coincidences. Fittingly and as promised, I don’t remember what day that was. Another night, I pre-emptively apologized and told her not to hate me, then played “eutaxies” — a triple word bingo with the “x” on a triple letter for 227 points. She messaged me a considerable growl, and five minutes later I went to bed with a smug grin plastered across my face. I took a screen shot of my play, printed it out and proudly showed my three interns the next day at work. It still hangs in my office today. And then, as I had long feared, something shifted. Two games at once turned into one. Our six-hour chat sessions dwindled to five, then four, then three. Eventually we played a full game without either of us sending a message. At one point, I gathered my courage and asked if I’d said anything wrong. She was quick to assure me I hadn’t. Yes, there were other factors at play. Her teaching break had ended, and she was back at work. That same day, my mother called to tell me her breast cancer had come back and she was having a mastectomy. Three days later, my father ended up in the hospital with a blood clot — a complication from leukemia. Still, if there was ever a week when I could have used six hours of nightly companionship, that was it. We stretched it out for another few weeks, playing a single move per day accompanied by a single chat, neither of us willing to concede the end. One night, I sent her a message thanking her for the last two months, letting her know that however unorthodox it had been, I had loved every minute. She told me she felt exactly the same. One day, we started what would be our final game. We each played a move. The next day, she didn’t play. Nor the day after. Ten days passed before Words With Friends automatically killed the game. The last time I saw her screen name was with the message, “They Timed Out.” Midsummer is when she was due to return to the States, but I don’t know if she ever did. July was also my one-year anniversary in Reno. Yet my happiest memories here have nothing to do with Nevada or the mountains or the university. They are of me sitting on my couch furiously tapping away on a three-inch screen to a woman on the other side of the world, a woman I know both intimately and not at all. I know how she felt when staring into the eyes of a buffalo up close. I know she would love to see “Owl Jeopardy,” where every response starts with “Whoooo.” I know she gets mildly aroused talking about compound miter saws and has a weird thing for hands and likes to sing songs about her cat. But I don’t know what she looks like when she sleeps. I don’t know the sound of her voice or the feel of her hair. I don’t even know her last name.</td>\n",

       "      <td>When Mary Lois and I started our relationship on that humid night in Stamford, Conn., we may not have expected it to last. After all, I was unable to scratch my own nose, let alone walk. And she was three years older than me and far more independent. I asked if I could kiss her. I had to ask because I couldn’t lean in on my own; my body doesn’t work that way. So she leaned in and kissed me as I had never been kissed before. “You were just a kid,” she told me recently. I was 19. She wore her straight auburn hair in a short boy-cut then. More than 30 years later, she still does, though the color has faded. I wasn’t only attracted to her iconoclastic spirit, alluring eyes and figure; I was on a mission to lose my virginity. I was born with spinal muscular atrophy, a congenital, progressive, incurable neuromuscular condition, but my lifelong disability has never prevented me from doing anything I set my mind to. I was one of the first quadriplegic students to matriculate at Harvard. And spinal muscular atrophy wasn’t going to keep me from having a girlfriend, getting married or having a family. I now write with a voice-recognition computer program. I no longer have the strength to hold or use a pencil. I drive my motorized wheelchair with a hypersensitive, lip-controlled mini joystick. Nevertheless, that first girlfriend and I have been married for nearly three decades. It’s a relationship that, in many ways, has only become more mysterious to me as the years have passed. Early on, I took for granted the fact that I would find love. I was cocky that way. But over time I have wondered why and how my marriage has worked out. So when I landed a contract several years ago to write about love between people with disabilities and people without, I figured I would start with my own marriage. When I asked Mary Lois what she first saw in me — a wheelchair-using teenager whose condition was only going to worsen — she said, “You weren’t aggressive. But you had a hunger that was sexy.” It felt strange to be interviewing her. She is, after all, my lifelong companion and the mother of our two daughters, both now in college. “I knew I was safe with you,” she said. “It was only going to go as far and as fast as I wanted, which was something I needed at the time.” I had learned to live with my disability just as the world was learning to live with people with disabilities as a political force, a civil-rights movement. That no doubt helped my cause, which was simply to live a full and normal life. She’d had no experience dealing with someone like me. But she learned to live with my limitations — those caused by my atrophied muscles, my respiratory distresses and myriad external obstacles and attitudes — through real-world, on-the-job training. Rewinding the mental movie of our lives together, I see us on our first date a few weeks after that kiss, talking during a long evening stroll. We struggled to keep pace with each other as we moved by different means. There was an Elvis Costello concert in Manhattan. I made her walk 30 blocks through the sweltering stench of Hell’s Kitchen in her date shoes and slinky pink dress because in those days New York buses and taxis weren’t wheelchair accessible, and I didn’t yet have a van. Along the way, strangers harassed us with rude remarks. We ignored them, but such comments would follow us for the rest of our lives. I believe a part of us grew stronger because of them. The novelty of our relationship became an asset, not a liability. We thought, in our innocence: Why shouldn’t we throw in our lots together? Toward the end of that night, emboldened by a couple of Black Russians downed at a bar on the walk back, I suggested she ride on my lap. “Your feet hurt,” I said. She resisted, but like many disabled people, I had learned not to take no for an answer. Although then, as before, everything relied on my powers of persuasion. And my charm. Or so I like to think. “Really,” I said. “Climb on. It won’t hurt.” Whether I meant it wouldn’t hurt her or me, I no longer recall. Was it the sheer force of my personality — my gentle boldness — that made her not only jump on my lap but also fall in love with me? It certainly wasn’t the ease with which I move through life. But there was another reason. A few years earlier, she had come to Stamford for the summer to look after my infant half brother. She was still in college and was at loose ends. So by that first date, we had already spent a lot of time living in the same house. “I think that’s how you flew under my radar,” she said. “Because we were able to become friends first without any pressure.” This proximity also gave her time to get used to my disability, to see how my family handled it, to demystify it. Nevertheless, even if my disability made me seem harmless, she admitted she was nervous during our first sexual encounters in the weeks that followed that concert — afraid, primarily, about injuring me. “You were so fragile looking,” she said. “And I was worried about balancing in the tiny bed. And if there was a problem, would I have to go get your attendant? Or worse, your dad?” I shudder to think. None of that had ever occurred to me. “But you survived the first few encounters,” she said. “And then came the miracle when I was able to lift you.” I remember it well. Several months later, on a desperate whim, she tried lifting me out of my wheelchair and discovered she could. I weighed about 120 pounds — not nothing — yet somehow she managed it. Which meant from then on we could go almost anywhere and do anything without an attendant tagging along. Over time, she wanted to do more for me: shaving me, for instance, or clipping and cleaning my fingernails. At first I resisted, but she did these things better than any paid person could. She had a vested interest in my grooming. For better and worse, disability tends to break down the barriers of privacy. When someone must assist you with dressing, bathing and using the bathroom, you come to understand each other’s most intimate processes and needs. (I still have paid help every day, but she fills the gaps.) “We faced challenges as they arrived, survived them, even grew from them,” she said. “But if I had foreseen them all at once, they would’ve been too terrifying.” Terrifying? I want to ask her more about that. But I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. You meet problems as they arise. Besides, the important question on my mind is: What happens when those challenges become too much? “I think the same is true for many people,” she said. Meaning we all face challenges we didn’t anticipate. “Disability is part of it. But there are so many kinds of troubles families endure.” Early on, before we had children, I got deeply involved in disability rights (and pride), a movement that can sometimes view able-bodied people as the enemy, as oppressors. For a while this led me to feel more bonded with a disabled woman and fellow advocate than with my wife. Then, 10 years ago, I nearly died from complications of gastrointestinal surgery, a monthslong crisis that humbled us both. I wanted to know: What would she do differently if she had it to do over again. What advice would she offer a young, able-bodied woman considering a relationship with a disabled young man? “I think I was better off not knowing the challenges,” she said. “Perhaps just the knowledge that we’re still together and best friends all these years later. To know that in advance would sustain me in those times when it didn’t seem possible.” True. Most couples face seemingly indomitable trials. What’s different about us is we dealt with those tests sooner, not later. We began with few illusions or unrealistic expectations (unless you consider my wanting to have sex, get married and start a family to be unrealistic!). And the truth is that once you have had your children straighten you in your wheelchair or drive it down the street when your hand gives out, your whole perception of propriety and family roles tends to get upended. Which is another way of saying that my disability has been, in a strange way, liberating, allowing us to live, and love, as we wish.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was 13 years old, standing on stage with a group of fellow teenagers, when our pastor announced in front of the entire congregation, “These young people have all made the righteous decision to save themselves for marriage.” It was the grand finale to a weekend-long purity retreat, which was basically two days of journaling, praying and listening to frightening statistics about premarital sex. We were told our virginity was the most precious wedding gift, and if we didn’t wait until marriage to have sex, we were likely to get divorced. Attendees were overwhelmingly girls. I grew up in a small town in Oklahoma where most of the community belonged to a denomination of Christianity that abstains from drinking and dancing. Growing up, I had conformed to that belief system. The cool crowd at my school wasn’t the partyers or potheads but the devout Christians. In an attempt to fit in, there I was on stage, slipping a silver purity ring onto my finger. The ring was modest, dainty and feminine, just as I was supposed to be. I wore that ring for years. I fantasized about having it melted down and turned into my future husband’s wedding band. I grew up believing two things. One: Love and sex are mutually exclusive. And two: My sexuality is not my own. It belonged to Jesus and then, once I married, to my husband. I sensed that my sexuality was something of great worth to other people. Whether in protecting or exploiting it, I understood that it was powerful. It’s hard for me to pinpoint why I stopped believing. It had to do with the increasingly obvious hypocrisy within my own community. Girls would use prayer requests as a mode of gossip, saying things like, “I have a prayer request for Hannah because I heard she had sex with Tanner.” I was also coming of age, beginning to think for myself, and realizing there are other ways to live my life. I took my ring off when I was 16. Once my ring was gone, I didn’t fit in with the girls at my small, conservative school, so I began to try to be as different from them as possible and, in my mind, therefore better. I adopted a sort of quasi feminism in lieu of my faith. I had a misguided idea of what a modern feminist had to be: left-leaning politically, powerful, independent and sexually liberated. To me, sexually liberated meant promiscuous. I was not promiscuous. In fact, I had made it through my teens without even a second glance from a boy. I chalked it up to the fact that the cowboy jocks at my school just didn’t get how cool and different I was. But deep down, I longed to be the object of pursuit. It became my mission to lose my virginity. My friends who had already lost theirs said, “Once it’s gone, you can never get it back,” as if they were trying to hold on to their virgin status through me. But it was the only thing left I had to expel in order to erase the girl I had been on that stage. I thought that once I was no longer a virgin, I would finally be free. I wanted to claim a new sense of identity. I wanted to be free to sleep with other men. I wanted the pressure of my “first time” to be gone. This wouldn’t happen for me until after I graduated, when I moved New York City for college, lost 30 pounds and went blond. At the Fashion Institute of Technology, where 85 percent of students are women, the dating scene was bleak. So on weekends, I would go to college bars, dressed in black, and marvel at the guys who wanted to buy me drinks and tell me I was pretty, all in the feeble hope that I might go home with them. They seemed as if they would do anything. But I had certain criteria for that man. First, I had to be able to trust him. Second, I could not be in love with him. While I expected him to care about me, I wanted to have the upper hand. I was on vacation back in my Oklahoma hometown when my friends told me they had met a group of musicians. I was happy to tag along to the bar, where they introduced me to three guys. One was Zach, who was tall and awkward with thick frame glasses and a shy smile. I ignored him for most of the night, until the group made its way back to his house. Once there, with my options for the evening dwindling, I took a liking to Zach. We all sat in a circle and played quarters. I pretended to be bad so he could show me how to bounce the coin. He played John Mayer songs on his guitar, which was swoonworthy to drunken 20-something girls. He wasn’t particularly smooth or charming, but his lack of confidence built up mine. As the weeks passed by, I saw more of him. He talked with me in the car one night for three hours while I sobered up. He told me he wanted a vacuum for his birthday, and I thought he was so different from the immature slobs I was used to. But most important, I always believed I was the one in control. Late one night when we were texting, I ended up at his house. I knew exactly what I had come for. Once we were in bed, things came to a standstill. I stopped kissing him and delivered the classic line, “What are you thinking right now?” “I don’t know. What are you thinking?” “I’m thinking I want you to be my first,” I said, “if you’re comfortable with that.” I didn’t want to be some meek little girl who was too scared to ask for what she wanted. “O.K.,” he replied with a smile. “I want you to know, it’s really important to me that we remain friends after this. I know I live halfway across the country, and this isn’t going to be a relationship, but I would like you to be a part of my life.” He agreed to this. I was surprised by how quickly it was over. It was painful yet gratifying. Zach was careful and quiet. I felt so responsible that we used protection and I remembered to go to the bathroom right after. I did everything exactly right. Afterward, he held me while fighting the urge to sleep. I didn’t stay the night. I wanted to sleep in my own bed. As I drove down the highway, windows open and the radio buzzing, I did feel a sense of freedom and empowerment. I had set out to do something and had done it on my terms. This sense of satisfaction didn’t come from having a fulfilling sexual experience; it came from the fact that I now thought I had nothing left to lose.  The night I landed back in New York, he sent me a text: “missing you.” After that, our communication was restricted to my drunk texts that went unacknowledged by him. I thought about him a lot in the following months. I lurked on his Facebook page. What was he doing? Was he thinking about me? After a particularly brutal, lonely winter, I decided I needed to visit home, and my desire to see Zach played a large part in that decision. I thought if I went home, I could figure out what was going on between us. The answer was nothing. While I was home, I posted on every social media platform announcing I was back in town, hoping he would see it and contact me. When that didn’t work, I texted him. He texted back but evaded any suggestion to meet up. By the end of my trip, I knew he simply didn’t care. I hadn’t romanticized my first time. I never thought we were in love. I never expected good sex. I never expected to have feelings afterward. And I certainly didn’t expect to feel rejected. I thought if I did everything right, I could control the emotions involved in physical intimacy. I was mad at Zach because I assumed he had used me. In reality, I had used him for something maybe even worse than physical gratification; I used him for a feeling of power, superiority and freedom. And when I realized he didn’t care, I let him take those feelings away. I thought losing my virginity would liberate me, and in a sense it did. I learned that no matter how calculating I am — right guy, right time, right place — I can’t control other people’s feelings, or even my own. And there’s a strange freedom in that knowledge. It allowed me to let go.</td>\n",

       "208  Her OkCupid profile mentioned that she was really good at Scrabble, so I sent her a message challenging her to a game of Words With Friends. “Loser buys the winner coffee,” I wrote. “You game?” She accepted but told me coffee wasn’t possible; she was in China for the school year teaching English and wouldn’t be back until July. It was now January. I had moved to Reno from Washington, D.C., six months earlier to take a job at the University of Nevada and was having trouble meeting people. Over those months, I had messaged more than 60 women and heard back from only six, leading to zero dates. So it seemed cruelly fitting that the first woman I really connected with had moved to China. But hey, a good Words With Friends partner can be even harder to find than love. Later that evening, she challenged me to a game, at 6 p.m. for me, 9 a.m. for her. An odd first date: half a world between us, sitting on my couch with phone in hand, looking for bingos and hoping to draw an “S” or a blank. Play a move, send a message. Repeat. We were evenly matched. I barely won our first game. Soon we were playing two games at once and chatting in both, two entirely different conversational threads — one serious and the other playful. We kept this up for six straight hours. At one point, I had to slide my couch closer to an outlet because my battery was at 2 percent. Like any good first date, I didn’t want it to end. We talked about everything from our childhood pets (her rats, Mr. Peepers and Tefnut, and my dog, Inky) to my fanciful dream of one day running a retirement home for animals: geriatric cows and octogenarian pigs happily living out their golden years with nothing whatsoever expected from them. She told me the worst gift she had ever given a boyfriend was a giant Hershey bar. I confessed that I’m more likely to cry during a movie trailer than while watching the actual movie. I told her I always botch clichés — “It’s not like it’s rocket surgery.” Falling asleep that night, happier than I’d felt in some time, I wondered if I was being catfished. Those six hours had been too good, the kind of night you dream about, and then suddenly the sun is rising. Ridiculous, flirtatious or serious — whatever the topic, it was always easy. The next night was no different, and I realized I had to start getting this down on paper. When a game ended, our chats from that game ended with it. Every 45 minutes or so, everything would disappear, and I wanted to preserve all of it, proof that such things are possible, and at any age. After a week, I told my best friend back East what was happening. She told me a story about a co-worker who had an online relationship with a woman for two years. Now they are married. I laughed it off and thanked her, but I told her I had no illusions. We were always brutally honest about our future, namely in agreeing there wasn’t one. It wasn’t even clear that she was coming back to Reno; she would go wherever she managed to land a job. We were a most pleasant distraction for each other, but school would eventually resume for her, and I’d eventually meet someone in Reno. On the Words With Friends board, we were both masters of the endgame, but there didn’t seem to be any endgame for us in real life. I also knew that it was the baked-in distance and the impossibility of a date that had allowed me to fall so deeply in the first place. In person, I’m typically so shy in romantic situations that I can barely make eye contact with someone I’ve just met. With her, I felt free to open myself up entirely. Two weeks in, after playing and chatting four to six hours every night, she warned me that she was meeting her father in South Korea the coming weekend and wouldn’t be around to keep up our nightly ritual. It’s strange to miss someone you have never actually met. In the morning, I awoke to a message she had sent from the airport, waiting out a delay. This single message meant more to me than the thousands of others we had exchanged. When I took my first business trip as a single man a few years earlier, I remember wishing I had someone to text from the airport. I had internalized the idea that love is having someone who cares about every utterly benign detail of your travel. “I made it!” I wanted to tap out. “Man, I think I parked in the furthest possible spot.” “The line at security is insane — is it spring break or something?” “Ok, at my gate!” “Boarding!” “Shutting down now, about to take off :).” All those imagined texts with no recipient. It stung even more when my plane touched down several hours later with nobody to tell I’d arrived safely. Our three days “apart” didn’t stall anything. After she returned, we slid right back into our routine of increasingly intimate disclosures. The times we each tried to rescue a hurt animal we came across. The worst thing I did as a kid that I still feel guilty about. Growing up in broken homes. Worst dating experience. Favorite sex position. Ever fake an orgasm? She agreed with me that the biggest commitment either of us could ever make would be combining our libraries, and that we probably shouldn’t take that step until we had at least two kids. One night, I told her my memory is extremely selective: I’ll remember she played the clarinet until sixth grade, yet consistently forget her birthday. It turned out that very day was her birthday. By that point, we had long stopped being surprised at the freakish number of coincidences. Fittingly and as promised, I don’t remember what day that was. Another night, I pre-emptively apologized and told her not to hate me, then played “eutaxies” — a triple word bingo with the “x” on a triple letter for 227 points. She messaged me a considerable growl, and five minutes later I went to bed with a smug grin plastered across my face. I took a screen shot of my play, printed it out and proudly showed my three interns the next day at work. It still hangs in my office today. And then, as I had long feared, something shifted. Two games at once turned into one. Our six-hour chat sessions dwindled to five, then four, then three. Eventually we played a full game without either of us sending a message. At one point, I gathered my courage and asked if I’d said anything wrong. She was quick to assure me I hadn’t. Yes, there were other factors at play. Her teaching break had ended, and she was back at work. That same day, my mother called to tell me her breast cancer had come back and she was having a mastectomy. Three days later, my father ended up in the hospital with a blood clot — a complication from leukemia. Still, if there was ever a week when I could have used six hours of nightly companionship, that was it. We stretched it out for another few weeks, playing a single move per day accompanied by a single chat, neither of us willing to concede the end. One night, I sent her a message thanking her for the last two months, letting her know that however unorthodox it had been, I had loved every minute. She told me she felt exactly the same. One day, we started what would be our final game. We each played a move. The next day, she didn’t play. Nor the day after. Ten days passed before Words With Friends automatically killed the game. The last time I saw her screen name was with the message, “They Timed Out.” Midsummer is when she was due to return to the States, but I don’t know if she ever did. July was also my one-year anniversary in Reno. Yet my happiest memories here have nothing to do with Nevada or the mountains or the university. They are of me sitting on my couch furiously tapping away on a three-inch screen to a woman on the other side of the world, a woman I know both intimately and not at all. I know how she felt when staring into the eyes of a buffalo up close. I know she would love to see “Owl Jeopardy,” where every response starts with “Whoooo.” I know she gets mildly aroused talking about compound miter saws and has a weird thing for hands and likes to sing songs about her cat. But I don’t know what she looks like when she sleeps. I don’t know the sound of her voice or the feel of her hair. I don’t even know her last name.                       \n",
       "117  When Mary Lois and I started our relationship on that humid night in Stamford, Conn., we may not have expected it to last. After all, I was unable to scratch my own nose, let alone walk. And she was three years older than me and far more independent. I asked if I could kiss her. I had to ask because I couldn’t lean in on my own; my body doesn’t work that way. So she leaned in and kissed me as I had never been kissed before. “You were just a kid,” she told me recently. I was 19. She wore her straight auburn hair in a short boy-cut then. More than 30 years later, she still does, though the color has faded. I wasn’t only attracted to her iconoclastic spirit, alluring eyes and figure; I was on a mission to lose my virginity. I was born with spinal muscular atrophy, a congenital, progressive, incurable neuromuscular condition, but my lifelong disability has never prevented me from doing anything I set my mind to. I was one of the first quadriplegic students to matriculate at Harvard. And spinal muscular atrophy wasn’t going to keep me from having a girlfriend, getting married or having a family. I now write with a voice-recognition computer program. I no longer have the strength to hold or use a pencil. I drive my motorized wheelchair with a hypersensitive, lip-controlled mini joystick. Nevertheless, that first girlfriend and I have been married for nearly three decades. It’s a relationship that, in many ways, has only become more mysterious to me as the years have passed. Early on, I took for granted the fact that I would find love. I was cocky that way. But over time I have wondered why and how my marriage has worked out. So when I landed a contract several years ago to write about love between people with disabilities and people without, I figured I would start with my own marriage. When I asked Mary Lois what she first saw in me — a wheelchair-using teenager whose condition was only going to worsen — she said, “You weren’t aggressive. But you had a hunger that was sexy.” It felt strange to be interviewing her. She is, after all, my lifelong companion and the mother of our two daughters, both now in college. “I knew I was safe with you,” she said. “It was only going to go as far and as fast as I wanted, which was something I needed at the time.” I had learned to live with my disability just as the world was learning to live with people with disabilities as a political force, a civil-rights movement. That no doubt helped my cause, which was simply to live a full and normal life. She’d had no experience dealing with someone like me. But she learned to live with my limitations — those caused by my atrophied muscles, my respiratory distresses and myriad external obstacles and attitudes — through real-world, on-the-job training. Rewinding the mental movie of our lives together, I see us on our first date a few weeks after that kiss, talking during a long evening stroll. We struggled to keep pace with each other as we moved by different means. There was an Elvis Costello concert in Manhattan. I made her walk 30 blocks through the sweltering stench of Hell’s Kitchen in her date shoes and slinky pink dress because in those days New York buses and taxis weren’t wheelchair accessible, and I didn’t yet have a van. Along the way, strangers harassed us with rude remarks. We ignored them, but such comments would follow us for the rest of our lives. I believe a part of us grew stronger because of them. The novelty of our relationship became an asset, not a liability. We thought, in our innocence: Why shouldn’t we throw in our lots together? Toward the end of that night, emboldened by a couple of Black Russians downed at a bar on the walk back, I suggested she ride on my lap. “Your feet hurt,” I said. She resisted, but like many disabled people, I had learned not to take no for an answer. Although then, as before, everything relied on my powers of persuasion. And my charm. Or so I like to think. “Really,” I said. “Climb on. It won’t hurt.” Whether I meant it wouldn’t hurt her or me, I no longer recall. Was it the sheer force of my personality — my gentle boldness — that made her not only jump on my lap but also fall in love with me? It certainly wasn’t the ease with which I move through life. But there was another reason. A few years earlier, she had come to Stamford for the summer to look after my infant half brother. She was still in college and was at loose ends. So by that first date, we had already spent a lot of time living in the same house. “I think that’s how you flew under my radar,” she said. “Because we were able to become friends first without any pressure.” This proximity also gave her time to get used to my disability, to see how my family handled it, to demystify it. Nevertheless, even if my disability made me seem harmless, she admitted she was nervous during our first sexual encounters in the weeks that followed that concert — afraid, primarily, about injuring me. “You were so fragile looking,” she said. “And I was worried about balancing in the tiny bed. And if there was a problem, would I have to go get your attendant? Or worse, your dad?” I shudder to think. None of that had ever occurred to me. “But you survived the first few encounters,” she said. “And then came the miracle when I was able to lift you.” I remember it well. Several months later, on a desperate whim, she tried lifting me out of my wheelchair and discovered she could. I weighed about 120 pounds — not nothing — yet somehow she managed it. Which meant from then on we could go almost anywhere and do anything without an attendant tagging along. Over time, she wanted to do more for me: shaving me, for instance, or clipping and cleaning my fingernails. At first I resisted, but she did these things better than any paid person could. She had a vested interest in my grooming. For better and worse, disability tends to break down the barriers of privacy. When someone must assist you with dressing, bathing and using the bathroom, you come to understand each other’s most intimate processes and needs. (I still have paid help every day, but she fills the gaps.) “We faced challenges as they arrived, survived them, even grew from them,” she said. “But if I had foreseen them all at once, they would’ve been too terrifying.” Terrifying? I want to ask her more about that. But I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. You meet problems as they arise. Besides, the important question on my mind is: What happens when those challenges become too much? “I think the same is true for many people,” she said. Meaning we all face challenges we didn’t anticipate. “Disability is part of it. But there are so many kinds of troubles families endure.” Early on, before we had children, I got deeply involved in disability rights (and pride), a movement that can sometimes view able-bodied people as the enemy, as oppressors. For a while this led me to feel more bonded with a disabled woman and fellow advocate than with my wife. Then, 10 years ago, I nearly died from complications of gastrointestinal surgery, a monthslong crisis that humbled us both. I wanted to know: What would she do differently if she had it to do over again. What advice would she offer a young, able-bodied woman considering a relationship with a disabled young man? “I think I was better off not knowing the challenges,” she said. “Perhaps just the knowledge that we’re still together and best friends all these years later. To know that in advance would sustain me in those times when it didn’t seem possible.” True. Most couples face seemingly indomitable trials. What’s different about us is we dealt with those tests sooner, not later. We began with few illusions or unrealistic expectations (unless you consider my wanting to have sex, get married and start a family to be unrealistic!). And the truth is that once you have had your children straighten you in your wheelchair or drive it down the street when your hand gives out, your whole perception of propriety and family roles tends to get upended. Which is another way of saying that my disability has been, in a strange way, liberating, allowing us to live, and love, as we wish.  \n",
       "269  I was 13 years old, standing on stage with a group of fellow teenagers, when our pastor announced in front of the entire congregation, “These young people have all made the righteous decision to save themselves for marriage.” It was the grand finale to a weekend-long purity retreat, which was basically two days of journaling, praying and listening to frightening statistics about premarital sex. We were told our virginity was the most precious wedding gift, and if we didn’t wait until marriage to have sex, we were likely to get divorced. Attendees were overwhelmingly girls. I grew up in a small town in Oklahoma where most of the community belonged to a denomination of Christianity that abstains from drinking and dancing. Growing up, I had conformed to that belief system. The cool crowd at my school wasn’t the partyers or potheads but the devout Christians. In an attempt to fit in, there I was on stage, slipping a silver purity ring onto my finger. The ring was modest, dainty and feminine, just as I was supposed to be. I wore that ring for years. I fantasized about having it melted down and turned into my future husband’s wedding band. I grew up believing two things. One: Love and sex are mutually exclusive. And two: My sexuality is not my own. It belonged to Jesus and then, once I married, to my husband. I sensed that my sexuality was something of great worth to other people. Whether in protecting or exploiting it, I understood that it was powerful. It’s hard for me to pinpoint why I stopped believing. It had to do with the increasingly obvious hypocrisy within my own community. Girls would use prayer requests as a mode of gossip, saying things like, “I have a prayer request for Hannah because I heard she had sex with Tanner.” I was also coming of age, beginning to think for myself, and realizing there are other ways to live my life. I took my ring off when I was 16. Once my ring was gone, I didn’t fit in with the girls at my small, conservative school, so I began to try to be as different from them as possible and, in my mind, therefore better. I adopted a sort of quasi feminism in lieu of my faith. I had a misguided idea of what a modern feminist had to be: left-leaning politically, powerful, independent and sexually liberated. To me, sexually liberated meant promiscuous. I was not promiscuous. In fact, I had made it through my teens without even a second glance from a boy. I chalked it up to the fact that the cowboy jocks at my school just didn’t get how cool and different I was. But deep down, I longed to be the object of pursuit. It became my mission to lose my virginity. My friends who had already lost theirs said, “Once it’s gone, you can never get it back,” as if they were trying to hold on to their virgin status through me. But it was the only thing left I had to expel in order to erase the girl I had been on that stage. I thought that once I was no longer a virgin, I would finally be free. I wanted to claim a new sense of identity. I wanted to be free to sleep with other men. I wanted the pressure of my “first time” to be gone. This wouldn’t happen for me until after I graduated, when I moved New York City for college, lost 30 pounds and went blond. At the Fashion Institute of Technology, where 85 percent of students are women, the dating scene was bleak. So on weekends, I would go to college bars, dressed in black, and marvel at the guys who wanted to buy me drinks and tell me I was pretty, all in the feeble hope that I might go home with them. They seemed as if they would do anything. But I had certain criteria for that man. First, I had to be able to trust him. Second, I could not be in love with him. While I expected him to care about me, I wanted to have the upper hand. I was on vacation back in my Oklahoma hometown when my friends told me they had met a group of musicians. I was happy to tag along to the bar, where they introduced me to three guys. One was Zach, who was tall and awkward with thick frame glasses and a shy smile. I ignored him for most of the night, until the group made its way back to his house. Once there, with my options for the evening dwindling, I took a liking to Zach. We all sat in a circle and played quarters. I pretended to be bad so he could show me how to bounce the coin. He played John Mayer songs on his guitar, which was swoonworthy to drunken 20-something girls. He wasn’t particularly smooth or charming, but his lack of confidence built up mine. As the weeks passed by, I saw more of him. He talked with me in the car one night for three hours while I sobered up. He told me he wanted a vacuum for his birthday, and I thought he was so different from the immature slobs I was used to. But most important, I always believed I was the one in control. Late one night when we were texting, I ended up at his house. I knew exactly what I had come for. Once we were in bed, things came to a standstill. I stopped kissing him and delivered the classic line, “What are you thinking right now?” “I don’t know. What are you thinking?” “I’m thinking I want you to be my first,” I said, “if you’re comfortable with that.” I didn’t want to be some meek little girl who was too scared to ask for what she wanted. “O.K.,” he replied with a smile. “I want you to know, it’s really important to me that we remain friends after this. I know I live halfway across the country, and this isn’t going to be a relationship, but I would like you to be a part of my life.” He agreed to this. I was surprised by how quickly it was over. It was painful yet gratifying. Zach was careful and quiet. I felt so responsible that we used protection and I remembered to go to the bathroom right after. I did everything exactly right. Afterward, he held me while fighting the urge to sleep. I didn’t stay the night. I wanted to sleep in my own bed. As I drove down the highway, windows open and the radio buzzing, I did feel a sense of freedom and empowerment. I had set out to do something and had done it on my terms. This sense of satisfaction didn’t come from having a fulfilling sexual experience; it came from the fact that I now thought I had nothing left to lose.  The night I landed back in New York, he sent me a text: “missing you.” After that, our communication was restricted to my drunk texts that went unacknowledged by him. I thought about him a lot in the following months. I lurked on his Facebook page. What was he doing? Was he thinking about me? After a particularly brutal, lonely winter, I decided I needed to visit home, and my desire to see Zach played a large part in that decision. I thought if I went home, I could figure out what was going on between us. The answer was nothing. While I was home, I posted on every social media platform announcing I was back in town, hoping he would see it and contact me. When that didn’t work, I texted him. He texted back but evaded any suggestion to meet up. By the end of my trip, I knew he simply didn’t care. I hadn’t romanticized my first time. I never thought we were in love. I never expected good sex. I never expected to have feelings afterward. And I certainly didn’t expect to feel rejected. I thought if I did everything right, I could control the emotions involved in physical intimacy. I was mad at Zach because I assumed he had used me. In reality, I had used him for something maybe even worse than physical gratification; I used him for a feeling of power, superiority and freedom. And when I realized he didn’t care, I let him take those feelings away. I thought losing my virginity would liberate me, and in a sense it did. I learned that no matter how calculating I am — right guy, right time, right place — I can’t control other people’s feelings, or even my own. And there’s a strange freedom in that knowledge. It allowed me to let go.

       "      <td>THE house was an enormous Tudor in a neighborhood I hardly ever visit: the rich, hilly part of San Francisco, with vistas to the Bay. I parked, grabbed my notebook and started up the drive. Above me, visible through the large window of their lighted kitchen, was the couple I had come to interview, the doctor and his wife. Wearing loose jeans and a T-shirt, the husband didn’t fit my idea of a stuffy doctor, and the wife, in her soft green yoga pants, seemed healthy, sweet.  I watched her spread peanut butter on bread, which the man folded into plastic bags, the intimacy between them palpable even from a distance. He squeezed her shoulder before leaving for another room.  A somewhat painful feeling arose in my throat. What was it that I had just seen? How would I write about it? And what had just happened to me? My breath was shallow. I waited, inhaled deeply, felt my ribs expand and the lump in my throat melt, and then I knocked. Next, as I have done now for two years, I stepped inside the home of complete strangers and asked them how they found love. My job is to interview couples for our city newspaper. When an editor called to see if I was interested in writing a weekly article, I was taken aback. I had been angling for a column for more than a decade, but when we met face to face and she said the word “relationships,” I was flummoxed.  “How couples meet, unusual courtship stories,” she elaborated. “Love stories.” It was a sweetheart of a job: make my own schedule, talk to interesting people, enjoy prime placement in the paper and make good money. “Great!” I barked, a little too loudly. “I’m not a romance kind of girl,” I admitted. I watched her sunny smile fade slightly. “But I’m fascinated by how other people fall in love,” I quickly added. What I didn’t say was that I was also jaded about love, having just split from the most recent of a string of not-quite-right girlfriends, the number of which, as I approached middle age, had reached into the double digits. I had dated this last not-right person for more than a year. On paper, we looked great together, with similar passions and compatible quirkiness. Yet I’d known from the beginning that something was missing: we had sparks, but no fireworks, a small flame that remained small despite my most ardent fanning. Occasionally she would sleep with someone else, though it hardly bothered me. That other person, it seemed to me, was no more her final destination than I was. Until, that is, she migrated permanently into that other person’s bed. So there I was, bruised of heart and single yet again, facing a challenge. An editor with an evangelical enthusiasm for a project, and me, a perennially single and somewhat cynical relationship flunky with a lust for newsprint column inches. “It sounds great,” I ventured without hesitation, all the while feeling as if I’d signed on to cross dangerous borders using false papers.  Perhaps because of my honesty, or more likely because of my résumé, I was offered the column on the love lives of Bay Area couples  straight, gay, married, single or even recently hooked up. No polyamory was the only parameter. I catapulted into my work. It’s what people do to distract themselves from a breakup, and there was that scary voice in my head that kept whispering: “You’re 50, you’re single ... good luck with that.” In the two years since, I’ve interviewed more than 200 people about how they met, married or merged, and time and again I’ve asked my incredulous questions. One man married a woman from the Mauritius Islands that he met through a French pen-pal organization. “You flew to Africa to meet someone after exchanging two postcards?” I asked. Not only that, but he proposed in less than a week. They’ve been married 10 years. An Italian-American guy paid the bridge toll for a cute girl in the car behind him: she married him. A couple met in a head-on collision (neither was badly hurt); another in a relocation camp for survivors after World War II. Two lesbians met as 9-year-olds in a Christian cult from which they escaped together after high school graduation. Now in their 40s, they’re still together, amused by  and grateful for  the rare circumstance of never having experienced a broken heart.  I’ve been impressed by arranged marriages I’ve learned about, wherein at the very least the couple share values  about money, education, family  and at most adore and cherish someone they met and married in a time frame shorter than a single rotation of the sun. A world map hangs in my office, poked with colorful pins marking the countries of origin of my subjects: the diversity of the Bay Area’s melting pot gives my column flavor. Yet what’s most foreign to me about them is not their culture or ethnicity. It’s their certainty about something as inexplicable as love. “How did you know?” I asked a woman who had met her future husband on a plane and swears she knew they would marry from the moment she squeezed into that middle seat.  “I felt it,” she repeated to my persistent inquiries.  Felt what? I have wondered more times than I care to recall. Inevitably, they turn the tables and ask me about my own relationship status. Sometimes I skirt the question, put up a journalistic smoke screen and simply deflect. But occasionally I give it a shot.  “How did you meet your husband?” This came at me few weeks ago from a Burmese political activist who met his wife in a Thai refugee camp. I didn’t bother to correct his gender presumption.  “I haven’t  yet,” I stammered.  Their faces fell. “How sad for you, this work,” the woman said. As I was leaving, she tucked a small statuette into my purse. “For good luck,” she told me. Another couple tried to set me up with their thrice-divorced son. AT times I feel like an anthropologist on Mars. So many of the people I interview have gut feelings and are hit with lightning bolts and simply “know.” But no matter how many times I hear these stories, and I hear them every week, I have yet to understand.  I’ve known things before, sure. The one time I really felt that magnetic feeling, for a charismatic blond Italian, I nearly ended up in the bin. Sure, the initial attraction was intense  ignited by a glance across a grocery store  but the flip side was like turning magnets’ backsides to each other. The repulsion  fights and jealousy and drama  was just as powerful. I can always turn to my rationalizations: My parents didn’t give me a great model for partnership, and maybe I’m missing the gene for long-term love. But at this age, really! That excuse seems both boring and tragic. My shrink says I need to stop asking questions, buckle down and learn to love. “Quit searching for the easy, mind-blowing, true-love story,” he says. “It’s an illusion.” “It’s my job,” I tell him, half smirking, as if I’m in on the joke. But then I go out and hear another of these stories and I wonder.  Sometimes I think it’s just a linguistic challenge: love is a noun, something precious that you find, or that finds you, like in many of the stories that end up beneath my byline. Or maybe my shrink is right and love is more a verb, something you do.  “We treat each other like we’re each other’s mothers,” said a Tibetan woman of her husband, “because in another life, we might have been.” Her marriage to an American Buddhist began as a way to immigrate, and then they started to have feelings for each other.  “Our hearts knew before our brains,” she told me. I wrote it down and read it over several times before deciding to make that the final line of their story  it will guarantee moist eyes, at least from some readers. But these love-as-verb stories are not as flashy or Hollywood-esque as the ones in which love falls from the sky. “It must be torture,” a woman told me the other week. “To be single and meet all of us lovebirds?” She had hooked up, after 40 years, with her high school nemesis. They had randomly crossed paths (without the help of the Internet) 3,000 miles from where they had grown up. Curled on her couch, she cooed into the shoulder of her new true love. I drive off from apartments, homes, trailers, even a center for people with developmental disabilities (where a couple had met at a special-needs summer camp), and I’m writing the column already, but I’m also thinking: Will anything like that ever happen to me? How happy are they really?  I put the key into the ignition, and wonder if, on the way home, someone will cross in front of my car and our eyes will meet and we will just know. In the years I’ve had this job I’ve gone from dating, to seeing someone, to seeing no one, to dating again. Yet I continue to ask, notebook in hand: How do people know with such certainty that their person is the one? Or do they not know and just decide? I’m paid to wonder about these things. But even if I weren’t, I’d still be looking through that window, questioning what was passing between that doctor and his wife  an outsider always peering in, ever curious  which, it turns out, is what makes me perfect for this job. Because after all my years in relationships, and the years of writing my column, the commonness of being fully coupled  that level of intimacy  is still as mysterious to me as the boundary of our universe. I can’t see it, but I know it must be out there somewhere.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BACK in the early ’90s, before I became a father and began my education in the heartbreak and hope of parental love, I lived on the crumbling fringe of Park Slope, Brooklyn, where every morning I’d drink coffee, smoke cigarettes and play jazz guitar for six to eight hours before heading off to wait tables. For years this routine was my life, and through it I felt connected to the city.  One bitterly cold afternoon I looked out my window to see the little boy who lived across the street wearing no coat, just a T-shirt and jeans, and clutching himself and crying.  His nickname was Booboo, and from what I’d heard his life was a near-perfect stereotype of urban poverty and neglect. His mother was in prison for crack and prostitution, and he’d been left in the care of his grandmother, a drunk who gambled their welfare money. Plump, near 50 and always in high heels, she carried herself as if she were still an object of great sexual interest. On a block where noise was constant, her shrill laughter cut through it all  you always knew where she was. I went downstairs and asked her if it was O.K. if I made Booboo some hot chocolate. She seemed only too happy to be free of the boy, who as it turned out had peed in his pants, which were freezing to his leg. You see so much sadness in New York that you become good at blocking it out. But now here was Booboo, a sad, vacant creature, inside my apartment. He was about 5, skinny, possibly malnourished, and seemed to exist solely on potato chips and candy. He had big eyes and a runny nose and was actually handsome, like a little child model. Except that he gave off no joy, no energy, seemed slow to understand and was delayed in his responses. His family and friends mainly spoke Spanish, so his English wasn’t very good. But he recognized that I was trying to do something nice for him, and he accepted the temporary improvement in his circumstances.  I made him hot chocolate, then set him up with a grilled cheese and a glass of orange juice and let him watch TV. It was odd having him in the apartment, another living creature in the midst of my solitude, a creature for whom I was suddenly responsible. And of course Booboo started coming around. I’d hear my buzzer, look out, and there he’d be, gazing up with those huge blank eyes, his grandmother across the street calling out in that piercing voice that it was O.K., and I’d say “O.K.” And she’d head up the block to drink and gamble and talk trash with her crew.  I wish I could say I made some kind of impact on Booboo, but I didn’t. All I did was take him in for a while and feed him. You do something like this and you think it’s going to be like “The Courtship of Eddie’s Father,” and you’ll have a clever relationship with a cute tyke who’s a bit of a tough but smart and funny and ultimately decent. But that’s not quite how it works, or at least it didn’t with Booboo and me.  I’d try to talk with him, seldom getting much more than monosyllabic responses. Sometimes, when he thought I wasn’t looking, he’d study my face as though he were searching it for a clue. Generally, he was happy enough to get things: food, warmth, TV. But as much as I wanted to reach him, it seemed that in some fundamental way it was already too late, that he’d probably go through life outside the circle, wondering what kept him apart. One day my buzzer rang, and I looked out and saw Booboo’s grandmother with a group of neighbors, all of them greeting me with angry expressions.  “Where’s Booboo?” the grandmother shrieked. Her face had that rose glow, and it was clear she’d been drinking.  “I don’t know.” “Where’s he at?” she demanded. “I’m coming down,” I said, and went downstairs to talk with her.  When I opened the door, she repeated her question, which was clearly an accusation, and I said again that I had no idea where Booboo was. “When’s the last time you saw him?” “Yesterday,” I said. “When’s the last time you saw him?” I asked, and that sent a tremor through the group. “That’s none of your business,” she said. “I told you not to trust this boy,” a neighbor said, and there were murmurs of agreement. I’d known all along I’d set myself up for this kind of suspicion and resentment, but went ahead and did what I could to help Booboo anyway. And now here it was, playing out in the worst possible way. “You can come up to my apartment and look around if you want,” I said. “And while you’re up here, we can call the police.” “We don’t need the police,” the grandmother said. And there was an awkward moment.  Then a teenage girl who lived in Booboo’s building came calling down the street that she’d found Booboo. And there he was, trailing along behind her, oblivious as ever. The next day the grandmother tried to apologize, explaining she had been in such a state that she wasn’t thinking right. Of course, I sensed her main concern was for herself. She’d voiced her resentment, and now she’d lost a place to ditch Booboo. I said I understood, but added that Booboo probably shouldn’t come into my apartment anymore.  And that was that. I turned away and did not look back. A couple of years later, I moved to Providence, R.I., and in time married and became a father of two. Our younger child, Phoebe, 7, is so quick to understand people and so kind in her understanding that it’s easy to forget she’s just a child.  The older one, Theo, 10, was born in the autism spectrum. His journey into the world has been very difficult. For him to be at a place where he can laugh and talk and feel at ease among people has required years of hard work. Back when we were expecting, I wondered what it would mean to be a father. I’d never had one myself. I’d had a stepfather for a while, but he wasn’t much of a dad and I never called him by anything other than his first name.  So as far as fathering went, I had no real point of reference. I just figured if our child were a boy, he’d be an approximate version of me, and that a girl would be an approximate version of my wife, Kate. We’d feed the kid organic food and everything would turn out fine.  On the day that Theo was born, all bloody with ears like a monkey, and the nurse let me hold him, whatever it was I expected to feel  a surge of love, of wonderment  stalled completely. I stood there, wooden, trying to cradle a baby that seemed more an alien offering than anything to which I was related. Loving him, my son, was apparently something I’d have to learn.  And loving Theo has required extensive education. Into his second year, he still wouldn’t meet our eyes. He wasn’t interested in us unless we were giving him something he wanted. No looking up with curiosity, with the desire to connect. I wasn’t an authority on babies, but I’d been around enough of them to see how they looked to their parents. And there were other things about Theo, too, things Kate and I pretended not to worry about. Nearing 2, he still didn’t speak a word. People would say things like, “Don’t worry, Einstein was slow to speak, too.” But it wasn’t just that Theo didn’t speak. He didn’t seem to understand the meaning of words. Not a one.  Later, we’d learn that’s called “receptive language.” Theo had no receptive language. When I retrieved him from day care, he would sit quietly in his car seat  no words, no sounds. If not for his tantrums and night terrors, he would have been a completely silent being.  Finally we owned up that something was wrong and scheduled an appointment at the hospital. After a full day of tests: the news.  I didn’t even know what autism was; they had to explain it. And even then, it was just words.  Soon enough, though, I came to understand exactly what such a disability means, for your child and for you. And I learned about early intervention and home-based services and vitamins and mercury and special diets and applied behavioral analysis and individualized education plans. But mostly I learned about the unrelenting frustration an autistic child experiences and the terrible rage it engenders, day after day, for years. IT’S sad to admit, but while some children are easy to love, others require more of us  sometimes more than it seems we’re capable of. But given the right combination of awful circumstances, you can discover surprising things about yourself. Loving Theo required lavishing affection upon him and receiving almost none in return. It required a willingness to think like him, to see the world through his eyes, so that he wouldn’t have to suffer constant frustration.  And it required work, a whole lot of grinding, tedious, physical work. More work than I ever could have imagined having to do for another human being. And yet I did it  most of the time with tenderness. These days, when I catch Theo’s eyes and tap my heart, he says sweetly and dutifully, “I love you, too, Dad,” and the sound of his voice, the look on his face, it cracks me up.  But what started me on this story: recently, while in New York for a conference, I went back to Brooklyn to see my old neighborhood. And as I walked the block where I had lived for those years, not recognizing anyone, I wondered what it was I’d expected to find.  And that’s when I remembered Booboo, and my heart caved. I hadn’t thought of him in years, hadn’t really allowed myself to.  That poor unloved boy. What could have become of him?</td>\n",

       "      <td>I NEVER did want children of my own. But competitive thoughts about family building started to invade my mind a little over two years ago, when my older brother and his wife had a baby girl. “Oh, so you think you’re just going to go and give birth?” I said to myself. “Well, I’ll show you: I’ll have five kids. No, eight! I’m going to be the best, most overachieving gay dad in America.” My drive for one-upmanship didn’t last long. Fearing that if I did have a child I would end up with a “We Need to Talk About Kevin” situation on my hands, I soon yielded to gentler emotions: pride at the sight of the flourishing family tree, a protective instinct and giddy excitement. Never mind my feelings for the child herself. Overnight, I had become that most doting and caricatured of family figures: the gay uncle. At last, after years of wondering what role I was meant to play in my family, I could step into one that seemed comfortable: august queer elder, good-natured corrupter, lover of art and literature, spinster-to-be. I couldn’t wait to fulfill this new purpose. Though I immediately flew across the country to begin teaching my niece about Hellenistic sculpture, I found her, at less than a month old, curiously glassy-eyed and incommunicative. I had to wait two years, at which point she began talking a blue streak. The moment I entered my brother’s house, I saw her staggering across the room, hand held aloft like some Lilliputian grande dame. “Oh!” she cried. “I have a hangnail!” “That’s more like it,” I thought. It’s true that during my less charitable moments of fighting for sidewalk space in child-rich neighborhoods like Park Slope, I’ve wanted to ash a cigarette over a double-wide stroller or two. Yet little kids and I tend to love one another’s company, if only because we invariably share the same psychotic imagination.  A close friend of mine in college was once astounded when, during a family visit, I hit it off better with her kid brother than with any of her other relatives. We were all out eating lunch together, and the wee lad next to whom I had been seated soon coaxed me into an extended dialogue about a bottle of Tapatío hot sauce on the table between us. “What if you got hot sauce in your eye?” he said. “Your eye would catch fire,” I said. “What if you used hot sauce as shampoo?” “Oh yeah. Your hair would catch fire. Oh yeah. And what if you filled a pool with hot sauce?” After a few more of these exchanges, I saw him start to slide, as kids often do when subjected to absurd repetition, into a state of delighted hysteria. To keep him from filling the restaurant with screams, I got him to start drawing with me. Still, he could barely contain his excitement as we illustrated a scene in which a hot-sauce storm struck the town, burning innocent bystanders with a piquant and appetizing acid rain. “Oh yeah, and the whole world was hot sauce!” he boomed in one final, crazed biblical proclamation. My niece proved a little slower to warm. To be fair, she was at that strange toddler age when language suddenly bursts onto the scene with such force that the parallel development of social graces can barely keep up. Before convention overtakes the sprawling wilds of speech, shaping them into a decorous topiary garden, kids (as the old slogan goes) say the darnedest things. It was at the tail end of this phase that I remember my much younger sister saying, in the midst of some neurotic Proustian monologue: “I don’t believe there’s a hell. That’s just something people tell you to make you behave.” My niece and I were goofing around in the yard when she zoomed off to play house in one of those plastic structures her parents had bought for her — the kind with beige, red and blue walls that lock together like a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. Believing myself invited, I followed, attempting to squeeze into the structure. It was decidedly not built to house giant adults. I managed to fit by crouching uncomfortably beside my niece, but she was not impressed. She stared at me for a second, then said, quite matter-of-factly, “Get out.” She offered this blunt command with an effortless, pleasant air, as though she had just said, “Here, have a chocolate éclair.” What could I do but leave the playhouse? And how many times had I longed to turn to some guest in my own apartment, some friend or acquaintance who had just walked in, and say the very same thing? We finally found some common ground later that afternoon when she wanted to go inside and spend some time with her wooden toy kitchen. Even I draw the line at playing Sylvia Plath with a 2-year-old, but it was her idea to put some of her favorite stuffed animals in the oven. Her father is a chef, so I assumed he wouldn’t mind. While I may have many years left in me, I find it unlikely that I’ll ever conceive through a surrogate or adopt. When I imagine my future, it doesn’t include the pitter-patter of little feet or the wailing of colicky newborns. It doesn’t necessarily even include domestic partnership. Oh, I know it all becomes more possible every day. If shows like “Modern Family” and “The New Normal” are any indication, the shopworn category of the solitary queer uncle is fast being replaced with gay characters who are compelled to find equal footing as part of nuclear family units. I love kids, but my own adulthood is shaping up to include reading in unbroken solitude, unencumbered travel, free hours in which to write and plenty of time with friends. Friendship, which Aristotle called a “slow ripening fruit,” seems to suit my temperament better than the fruits of partnership, or puréed fruit hurled at me from a highchair. I guess that whatever happens, we know there will be fruit. It wouldn’t make a great sitcom. JUST last week, I signed onto Skype to see my 6-month-old nephew, brother to my niece who roasts stuffed animals. On-screen, my own mother held the slack-jawed, tubby boy up for my viewing pleasure, as if he were Simba, the Lion King, or something. My niece sat on her mother’s knee, and my younger brother floated cheerfully in the background. “Something’s wrong with your computer,” my mother shouted. “You’re just a black shadow,” my sister-in-law said. She was right. In the corner of my screen I saw what they were seeing: a silhouette of me-shaped darkness. After several uncomfortable minutes, I finally got the webcam in working order. My features were now visible, but for some reason the image remained monochrome. “Well,” I said, “I guess you get me in black and white.” “Uncle Evan!” said my niece, surprised at my sudden appearance. I asked her what was new, and she explained, in ethereal tones, that she was eating a Popsicle. Before long, terrible microphone feedback struck, making conversation impossible. We decided to cut short our staring into webcams over the shrill whine of technical malfunction. I clicked the “X” in the corner of my screen, and my family disappeared. I was, as ever, alone in my apartment. I settled in to read a book, but I couldn’t stop thinking about my niece and nephew. I like to imagine that my siblings’ children will eventually make as many mistakes in life as the rest of us have. Who knows. But I hope, too, that I can live up to my new role if they do. If my niece eventually runs away from home, cuts off her hair and starts eating psychedelic mushrooms every day, I’ll be there to take her to look at Francis Bacon paintings, let her crash on my couch and listen to her talk about how she kind of wants to move to Berlin. Likewise, if my nephew — fat little question mark that he is at present — finds himself plunged into existential crisis in his mid-20s, I’ll be there. “Of course you should drop out of Harvard Business School and travel the world in a rickety schooner with three people you just met,” I’ll say. “What are you waiting for?” Most parents are stuck being the voice of reason; it’s the luck of the solitary gay uncle that he gets to be the voice of creative anarchy. Of course, my niece and nephew may become C.F.O.’s, gastroenterologists or personal injury lawyers. They might just decide they love the suburbs, marry young and find themselves wealthy, healthy and happy as clams. In which case, watch out, kids: it’ll be me coming to stay on your couch.</td>\n",

       "204  THE house was an enormous Tudor in a neighborhood I hardly ever visit: the rich, hilly part of San Francisco, with vistas to the Bay. I parked, grabbed my notebook and started up the drive. Above me, visible through the large window of their lighted kitchen, was the couple I had come to interview, the doctor and his wife. Wearing loose jeans and a T-shirt, the husband didn’t fit my idea of a stuffy doctor, and the wife, in her soft green yoga pants, seemed healthy, sweet.  I watched her spread peanut butter on bread, which the man folded into plastic bags, the intimacy between them palpable even from a distance. He squeezed her shoulder before leaving for another room.  A somewhat painful feeling arose in my throat. What was it that I had just seen? How would I write about it? And what had just happened to me? My breath was shallow. I waited, inhaled deeply, felt my ribs expand and the lump in my throat melt, and then I knocked. Next, as I have done now for two years, I stepped inside the home of complete strangers and asked them how they found love. My job is to interview couples for our city newspaper. When an editor called to see if I was interested in writing a weekly article, I was taken aback. I had been angling for a column for more than a decade, but when we met face to face and she said the word “relationships,” I was flummoxed.  “How couples meet, unusual courtship stories,” she elaborated. “Love stories.” It was a sweetheart of a job: make my own schedule, talk to interesting people, enjoy prime placement in the paper and make good money. “Great!” I barked, a little too loudly. “I’m not a romance kind of girl,” I admitted. I watched her sunny smile fade slightly. “But I’m fascinated by how other people fall in love,” I quickly added. What I didn’t say was that I was also jaded about love, having just split from the most recent of a string of not-quite-right girlfriends, the number of which, as I approached middle age, had reached into the double digits. I had dated this last not-right person for more than a year. On paper, we looked great together, with similar passions and compatible quirkiness. Yet I’d known from the beginning that something was missing: we had sparks, but no fireworks, a small flame that remained small despite my most ardent fanning. Occasionally she would sleep with someone else, though it hardly bothered me. That other person, it seemed to me, was no more her final destination than I was. Until, that is, she migrated permanently into that other person’s bed. So there I was, bruised of heart and single yet again, facing a challenge. An editor with an evangelical enthusiasm for a project, and me, a perennially single and somewhat cynical relationship flunky with a lust for newsprint column inches. “It sounds great,” I ventured without hesitation, all the while feeling as if I’d signed on to cross dangerous borders using false papers.  Perhaps because of my honesty, or more likely because of my résumé, I was offered the column on the love lives of Bay Area couples  straight, gay, married, single or even recently hooked up. No polyamory was the only parameter. I catapulted into my work. It’s what people do to distract themselves from a breakup, and there was that scary voice in my head that kept whispering: “You’re 50, you’re single ... good luck with that.” In the two years since, I’ve interviewed more than 200 people about how they met, married or merged, and time and again I’ve asked my incredulous questions. One man married a woman from the Mauritius Islands that he met through a French pen-pal organization. “You flew to Africa to meet someone after exchanging two postcards?” I asked. Not only that, but he proposed in less than a week. They’ve been married 10 years. An Italian-American guy paid the bridge toll for a cute girl in the car behind him: she married him. A couple met in a head-on collision (neither was badly hurt); another in a relocation camp for survivors after World War II. Two lesbians met as 9-year-olds in a Christian cult from which they escaped together after high school graduation. Now in their 40s, they’re still together, amused by  and grateful for  the rare circumstance of never having experienced a broken heart.  I’ve been impressed by arranged marriages I’ve learned about, wherein at the very least the couple share values  about money, education, family  and at most adore and cherish someone they met and married in a time frame shorter than a single rotation of the sun. A world map hangs in my office, poked with colorful pins marking the countries of origin of my subjects: the diversity of the Bay Area’s melting pot gives my column flavor. Yet what’s most foreign to me about them is not their culture or ethnicity. It’s their certainty about something as inexplicable as love. “How did you know?” I asked a woman who had met her future husband on a plane and swears she knew they would marry from the moment she squeezed into that middle seat.  “I felt it,” she repeated to my persistent inquiries.  Felt what? I have wondered more times than I care to recall. Inevitably, they turn the tables and ask me about my own relationship status. Sometimes I skirt the question, put up a journalistic smoke screen and simply deflect. But occasionally I give it a shot.  “How did you meet your husband?” This came at me few weeks ago from a Burmese political activist who met his wife in a Thai refugee camp. I didn’t bother to correct his gender presumption.  “I haven’t  yet,” I stammered.  Their faces fell. “How sad for you, this work,” the woman said. As I was leaving, she tucked a small statuette into my purse. “For good luck,” she told me. Another couple tried to set me up with their thrice-divorced son. AT times I feel like an anthropologist on Mars. So many of the people I interview have gut feelings and are hit with lightning bolts and simply “know.” But no matter how many times I hear these stories, and I hear them every week, I have yet to understand.  I’ve known things before, sure. The one time I really felt that magnetic feeling, for a charismatic blond Italian, I nearly ended up in the bin. Sure, the initial attraction was intense  ignited by a glance across a grocery store  but the flip side was like turning magnets’ backsides to each other. The repulsion  fights and jealousy and drama  was just as powerful. I can always turn to my rationalizations: My parents didn’t give me a great model for partnership, and maybe I’m missing the gene for long-term love. But at this age, really! That excuse seems both boring and tragic. My shrink says I need to stop asking questions, buckle down and learn to love. “Quit searching for the easy, mind-blowing, true-love story,” he says. “It’s an illusion.” “It’s my job,” I tell him, half smirking, as if I’m in on the joke. But then I go out and hear another of these stories and I wonder.  Sometimes I think it’s just a linguistic challenge: love is a noun, something precious that you find, or that finds you, like in many of the stories that end up beneath my byline. Or maybe my shrink is right and love is more a verb, something you do.  “We treat each other like we’re each other’s mothers,” said a Tibetan woman of her husband, “because in another life, we might have been.” Her marriage to an American Buddhist began as a way to immigrate, and then they started to have feelings for each other.  “Our hearts knew before our brains,” she told me. I wrote it down and read it over several times before deciding to make that the final line of their story  it will guarantee moist eyes, at least from some readers. But these love-as-verb stories are not as flashy or Hollywood-esque as the ones in which love falls from the sky. “It must be torture,” a woman told me the other week. “To be single and meet all of us lovebirds?” She had hooked up, after 40 years, with her high school nemesis. They had randomly crossed paths (without the help of the Internet) 3,000 miles from where they had grown up. Curled on her couch, she cooed into the shoulder of her new true love. I drive off from apartments, homes, trailers, even a center for people with developmental disabilities (where a couple had met at a special-needs summer camp), and I’m writing the column already, but I’m also thinking: Will anything like that ever happen to me? How happy are they really?  I put the key into the ignition, and wonder if, on the way home, someone will cross in front of my car and our eyes will meet and we will just know. In the years I’ve had this job I’ve gone from dating, to seeing someone, to seeing no one, to dating again. Yet I continue to ask, notebook in hand: How do people know with such certainty that their person is the one? Or do they not know and just decide? I’m paid to wonder about these things. But even if I weren’t, I’d still be looking through that window, questioning what was passing between that doctor and his wife  an outsider always peering in, ever curious  which, it turns out, is what makes me perfect for this job. Because after all my years in relationships, and the years of writing my column, the commonness of being fully coupled  that level of intimacy  is still as mysterious to me as the boundary of our universe. I can’t see it, but I know it must be out there somewhere.   \n",
       "201  BACK in the early ’90s, before I became a father and began my education in the heartbreak and hope of parental love, I lived on the crumbling fringe of Park Slope, Brooklyn, where every morning I’d drink coffee, smoke cigarettes and play jazz guitar for six to eight hours before heading off to wait tables. For years this routine was my life, and through it I felt connected to the city.  One bitterly cold afternoon I looked out my window to see the little boy who lived across the street wearing no coat, just a T-shirt and jeans, and clutching himself and crying.  His nickname was Booboo, and from what I’d heard his life was a near-perfect stereotype of urban poverty and neglect. His mother was in prison for crack and prostitution, and he’d been left in the care of his grandmother, a drunk who gambled their welfare money. Plump, near 50 and always in high heels, she carried herself as if she were still an object of great sexual interest. On a block where noise was constant, her shrill laughter cut through it all  you always knew where she was. I went downstairs and asked her if it was O.K. if I made Booboo some hot chocolate. She seemed only too happy to be free of the boy, who as it turned out had peed in his pants, which were freezing to his leg. You see so much sadness in New York that you become good at blocking it out. But now here was Booboo, a sad, vacant creature, inside my apartment. He was about 5, skinny, possibly malnourished, and seemed to exist solely on potato chips and candy. He had big eyes and a runny nose and was actually handsome, like a little child model. Except that he gave off no joy, no energy, seemed slow to understand and was delayed in his responses. His family and friends mainly spoke Spanish, so his English wasn’t very good. But he recognized that I was trying to do something nice for him, and he accepted the temporary improvement in his circumstances.  I made him hot chocolate, then set him up with a grilled cheese and a glass of orange juice and let him watch TV. It was odd having him in the apartment, another living creature in the midst of my solitude, a creature for whom I was suddenly responsible. And of course Booboo started coming around. I’d hear my buzzer, look out, and there he’d be, gazing up with those huge blank eyes, his grandmother across the street calling out in that piercing voice that it was O.K., and I’d say “O.K.” And she’d head up the block to drink and gamble and talk trash with her crew.  I wish I could say I made some kind of impact on Booboo, but I didn’t. All I did was take him in for a while and feed him. You do something like this and you think it’s going to be like “The Courtship of Eddie’s Father,” and you’ll have a clever relationship with a cute tyke who’s a bit of a tough but smart and funny and ultimately decent. But that’s not quite how it works, or at least it didn’t with Booboo and me.  I’d try to talk with him, seldom getting much more than monosyllabic responses. Sometimes, when he thought I wasn’t looking, he’d study my face as though he were searching it for a clue. Generally, he was happy enough to get things: food, warmth, TV. But as much as I wanted to reach him, it seemed that in some fundamental way it was already too late, that he’d probably go through life outside the circle, wondering what kept him apart. One day my buzzer rang, and I looked out and saw Booboo’s grandmother with a group of neighbors, all of them greeting me with angry expressions.  “Where’s Booboo?” the grandmother shrieked. Her face had that rose glow, and it was clear she’d been drinking.  “I don’t know.” “Where’s he at?” she demanded. “I’m coming down,” I said, and went downstairs to talk with her.  When I opened the door, she repeated her question, which was clearly an accusation, and I said again that I had no idea where Booboo was. “When’s the last time you saw him?” “Yesterday,” I said. “When’s the last time you saw him?” I asked, and that sent a tremor through the group. “That’s none of your business,” she said. “I told you not to trust this boy,” a neighbor said, and there were murmurs of agreement. I’d known all along I’d set myself up for this kind of suspicion and resentment, but went ahead and did what I could to help Booboo anyway. And now here it was, playing out in the worst possible way. “You can come up to my apartment and look around if you want,” I said. “And while you’re up here, we can call the police.” “We don’t need the police,” the grandmother said. And there was an awkward moment.  Then a teenage girl who lived in Booboo’s building came calling down the street that she’d found Booboo. And there he was, trailing along behind her, oblivious as ever. The next day the grandmother tried to apologize, explaining she had been in such a state that she wasn’t thinking right. Of course, I sensed her main concern was for herself. She’d voiced her resentment, and now she’d lost a place to ditch Booboo. I said I understood, but added that Booboo probably shouldn’t come into my apartment anymore.  And that was that. I turned away and did not look back. A couple of years later, I moved to Providence, R.I., and in time married and became a father of two. Our younger child, Phoebe, 7, is so quick to understand people and so kind in her understanding that it’s easy to forget she’s just a child.  The older one, Theo, 10, was born in the autism spectrum. His journey into the world has been very difficult. For him to be at a place where he can laugh and talk and feel at ease among people has required years of hard work. Back when we were expecting, I wondered what it would mean to be a father. I’d never had one myself. I’d had a stepfather for a while, but he wasn’t much of a dad and I never called him by anything other than his first name.  So as far as fathering went, I had no real point of reference. I just figured if our child were a boy, he’d be an approximate version of me, and that a girl would be an approximate version of my wife, Kate. We’d feed the kid organic food and everything would turn out fine.  On the day that Theo was born, all bloody with ears like a monkey, and the nurse let me hold him, whatever it was I expected to feel  a surge of love, of wonderment  stalled completely. I stood there, wooden, trying to cradle a baby that seemed more an alien offering than anything to which I was related. Loving him, my son, was apparently something I’d have to learn.  And loving Theo has required extensive education. Into his second year, he still wouldn’t meet our eyes. He wasn’t interested in us unless we were giving him something he wanted. No looking up with curiosity, with the desire to connect. I wasn’t an authority on babies, but I’d been around enough of them to see how they looked to their parents. And there were other things about Theo, too, things Kate and I pretended not to worry about. Nearing 2, he still didn’t speak a word. People would say things like, “Don’t worry, Einstein was slow to speak, too.” But it wasn’t just that Theo didn’t speak. He didn’t seem to understand the meaning of words. Not a one.  Later, we’d learn that’s called “receptive language.” Theo had no receptive language. When I retrieved him from day care, he would sit quietly in his car seat  no words, no sounds. If not for his tantrums and night terrors, he would have been a completely silent being.  Finally we owned up that something was wrong and scheduled an appointment at the hospital. After a full day of tests: the news.  I didn’t even know what autism was; they had to explain it. And even then, it was just words.  Soon enough, though, I came to understand exactly what such a disability means, for your child and for you. And I learned about early intervention and home-based services and vitamins and mercury and special diets and applied behavioral analysis and individualized education plans. But mostly I learned about the unrelenting frustration an autistic child experiences and the terrible rage it engenders, day after day, for years. IT’S sad to admit, but while some children are easy to love, others require more of us  sometimes more than it seems we’re capable of. But given the right combination of awful circumstances, you can discover surprising things about yourself. Loving Theo required lavishing affection upon him and receiving almost none in return. It required a willingness to think like him, to see the world through his eyes, so that he wouldn’t have to suffer constant frustration.  And it required work, a whole lot of grinding, tedious, physical work. More work than I ever could have imagined having to do for another human being. And yet I did it  most of the time with tenderness. These days, when I catch Theo’s eyes and tap my heart, he says sweetly and dutifully, “I love you, too, Dad,” and the sound of his voice, the look on his face, it cracks me up.  But what started me on this story: recently, while in New York for a conference, I went back to Brooklyn to see my old neighborhood. And as I walked the block where I had lived for those years, not recognizing anyone, I wondered what it was I’d expected to find.  And that’s when I remembered Booboo, and my heart caved. I hadn’t thought of him in years, hadn’t really allowed myself to.  That poor unloved boy. What could have become of him?  \n",
       "24   I NEVER did want children of my own. But competitive thoughts about family building started to invade my mind a little over two years ago, when my older brother and his wife had a baby girl. “Oh, so you think you’re just going to go and give birth?” I said to myself. “Well, I’ll show you: I’ll have five kids. No, eight! I’m going to be the best, most overachieving gay dad in America.” My drive for one-upmanship didn’t last long. Fearing that if I did have a child I would end up with a “We Need to Talk About Kevin” situation on my hands, I soon yielded to gentler emotions: pride at the sight of the flourishing family tree, a protective instinct and giddy excitement. Never mind my feelings for the child herself. Overnight, I had become that most doting and caricatured of family figures: the gay uncle. At last, after years of wondering what role I was meant to play in my family, I could step into one that seemed comfortable: august queer elder, good-natured corrupter, lover of art and literature, spinster-to-be. I couldn’t wait to fulfill this new purpose. Though I immediately flew across the country to begin teaching my niece about Hellenistic sculpture, I found her, at less than a month old, curiously glassy-eyed and incommunicative. I had to wait two years, at which point she began talking a blue streak. The moment I entered my brother’s house, I saw her staggering across the room, hand held aloft like some Lilliputian grande dame. “Oh!” she cried. “I have a hangnail!” “That’s more like it,” I thought. It’s true that during my less charitable moments of fighting for sidewalk space in child-rich neighborhoods like Park Slope, I’ve wanted to ash a cigarette over a double-wide stroller or two. Yet little kids and I tend to love one another’s company, if only because we invariably share the same psychotic imagination.  A close friend of mine in college was once astounded when, during a family visit, I hit it off better with her kid brother than with any of her other relatives. We were all out eating lunch together, and the wee lad next to whom I had been seated soon coaxed me into an extended dialogue about a bottle of Tapatío hot sauce on the table between us. “What if you got hot sauce in your eye?” he said. “Your eye would catch fire,” I said. “What if you used hot sauce as shampoo?” “Oh yeah. Your hair would catch fire. Oh yeah. And what if you filled a pool with hot sauce?” After a few more of these exchanges, I saw him start to slide, as kids often do when subjected to absurd repetition, into a state of delighted hysteria. To keep him from filling the restaurant with screams, I got him to start drawing with me. Still, he could barely contain his excitement as we illustrated a scene in which a hot-sauce storm struck the town, burning innocent bystanders with a piquant and appetizing acid rain. “Oh yeah, and the whole world was hot sauce!” he boomed in one final, crazed biblical proclamation. My niece proved a little slower to warm. To be fair, she was at that strange toddler age when language suddenly bursts onto the scene with such force that the parallel development of social graces can barely keep up. Before convention overtakes the sprawling wilds of speech, shaping them into a decorous topiary garden, kids (as the old slogan goes) say the darnedest things. It was at the tail end of this phase that I remember my much younger sister saying, in the midst of some neurotic Proustian monologue: “I don’t believe there’s a hell. That’s just something people tell you to make you behave.” My niece and I were goofing around in the yard when she zoomed off to play house in one of those plastic structures her parents had bought for her — the kind with beige, red and blue walls that lock together like a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. Believing myself invited, I followed, attempting to squeeze into the structure. It was decidedly not built to house giant adults. I managed to fit by crouching uncomfortably beside my niece, but she was not impressed. She stared at me for a second, then said, quite matter-of-factly, “Get out.” She offered this blunt command with an effortless, pleasant air, as though she had just said, “Here, have a chocolate éclair.” What could I do but leave the playhouse? And how many times had I longed to turn to some guest in my own apartment, some friend or acquaintance who had just walked in, and say the very same thing? We finally found some common ground later that afternoon when she wanted to go inside and spend some time with her wooden toy kitchen. Even I draw the line at playing Sylvia Plath with a 2-year-old, but it was her idea to put some of her favorite stuffed animals in the oven. Her father is a chef, so I assumed he wouldn’t mind. While I may have many years left in me, I find it unlikely that I’ll ever conceive through a surrogate or adopt. When I imagine my future, it doesn’t include the pitter-patter of little feet or the wailing of colicky newborns. It doesn’t necessarily even include domestic partnership. Oh, I know it all becomes more possible every day. If shows like “Modern Family” and “The New Normal” are any indication, the shopworn category of the solitary queer uncle is fast being replaced with gay characters who are compelled to find equal footing as part of nuclear family units. I love kids, but my own adulthood is shaping up to include reading in unbroken solitude, unencumbered travel, free hours in which to write and plenty of time with friends. Friendship, which Aristotle called a “slow ripening fruit,” seems to suit my temperament better than the fruits of partnership, or puréed fruit hurled at me from a highchair. I guess that whatever happens, we know there will be fruit. It wouldn’t make a great sitcom. JUST last week, I signed onto Skype to see my 6-month-old nephew, brother to my niece who roasts stuffed animals. On-screen, my own mother held the slack-jawed, tubby boy up for my viewing pleasure, as if he were Simba, the Lion King, or something. My niece sat on her mother’s knee, and my younger brother floated cheerfully in the background. “Something’s wrong with your computer,” my mother shouted. “You’re just a black shadow,” my sister-in-law said. She was right. In the corner of my screen I saw what they were seeing: a silhouette of me-shaped darkness. After several uncomfortable minutes, I finally got the webcam in working order. My features were now visible, but for some reason the image remained monochrome. “Well,” I said, “I guess you get me in black and white.” “Uncle Evan!” said my niece, surprised at my sudden appearance. I asked her what was new, and she explained, in ethereal tones, that she was eating a Popsicle. Before long, terrible microphone feedback struck, making conversation impossible. We decided to cut short our staring into webcams over the shrill whine of technical malfunction. I clicked the “X” in the corner of my screen, and my family disappeared. I was, as ever, alone in my apartment. I settled in to read a book, but I couldn’t stop thinking about my niece and nephew. I like to imagine that my siblings’ children will eventually make as many mistakes in life as the rest of us have. Who knows. But I hope, too, that I can live up to my new role if they do. If my niece eventually runs away from home, cuts off her hair and starts eating psychedelic mushrooms every day, I’ll be there to take her to look at Francis Bacon paintings, let her crash on my couch and listen to her talk about how she kind of wants to move to Berlin. Likewise, if my nephew — fat little question mark that he is at present — finds himself plunged into existential crisis in his mid-20s, I’ll be there. “Of course you should drop out of Harvard Business School and travel the world in a rickety schooner with three people you just met,” I’ll say. “What are you waiting for?” Most parents are stuck being the voice of reason; it’s the luck of the solitary gay uncle that he gets to be the voice of creative anarchy. Of course, my niece and nephew may become C.F.O.’s, gastroenterologists or personal injury lawyers. They might just decide they love the suburbs, marry young and find themselves wealthy, healthy and happy as clams. In which case, watch out, kids: it’ll be me coming to stay on your couch.

       "      <td>A FEW years ago I embarked on an ill-advised romance. From the start I had significant reservations about the man: not the right reservations, it would turn out, but reservations nonetheless. For one, he held a part-time job at the local food co-op as a cheese cutter, and how long could I go without making a \"Did you cut the cheese?\" joke? Oh, not long. Not long at all. He was also an adjunct assistant professor in the local university's art department, and, as everyone knows, there's no one in this world more bitter than an adjunct. In addition he lived in a house he had built himself. There was nothing wrong with his living in a house he had built himself. What was wrong was that the house he had built was only big enough for him. It was 8 feet by 12 feet. It had wheels and would therefore be easy to flee town in. To make matters worse, the tiny house had a name. And that name was Tumbleweed. All this normally would have bothered me. But none of it did. Because, I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for a pretty face, and the Tiny House Man's face was very pretty, delicately featured yet masculine. Unfortunately it was bearded in the soul patch style, which can make any chin look vaguely pudendal, but that was nothing that a persuasive girlfriend and a lovingly applied coat of Nair couldn't eventually take care of. So the Tiny House Man and I made plans for dinner, and we agreed to meet first at the tiny house, so that I might see how tiny it was. Once at the house, which was tiny indeed, I was greeted by the Tiny House Man. I saw that he was wearing Teva sandals. I hate Teva sandals. He opened a bottle of wine, and it was not long before I forgot that I hated Teva sandals. THE Tiny House Man and I drank and laughed and drank some more and laughed some more and forgot completely about going to dinner. At one point he excused himself to go outside. (The tiny house was not equipped with a working toilet; its builder and owner was, it appeared, a big proponent of composting.) While he relieved himself, I sat on the tiny floor of his tiny house and looked at his one bookshelf, which was stocked exclusively with books about tiny houses and a good number of tantric sex manuals. When he returned from communing with or, in this particular instance, insulting nature, he sat by my side. Very close by my side. I wondered whether our proximity was a function of limited real estate or genuine romantic interest. But soon our shoulders touched. And then our hands. And then our lips. The angels sang. And then the angels all of a sudden stopped singing. He pulled himself abruptly away. \"There's something I have to tell you,\" he said. I wondered what this something might be: I have hepatitis C? I'm a preoperative transsexual? Tumbleweed isn't up to code? \"I have a girlfriend, but she cheated on me, and I told her that I'd break up with her as soon as I met someone else.\" I liked the idea of being someone's someone else. I didn't like the idea that that someone had a girlfriend. \"I'm flattered,\" I said. \"But it might have been nice if you'd broken up with her before you asked me out on a date.\" \"This isn't a date,\" he said. \"I don't know where you got the idea that this was a date.\" Now, a person who was smarter, and not so hard up, would have left the tiny house as soon as she heard the word girlfriend. But I was not so smart, and quite hard up, and the Tiny House Man was saying such nice things to me during our nondate -- how pretty I was, how intelligent, how witty -- and I grew more and more smitten with each addition to the apparently endless catalog of my wonderfulness. He said he wanted to see me again. I said I wanted to see him again, but what about his girlfriend? He said he didn't want to hurt his girlfriend, so he couldn't break up with her right now. When was he planning to break up with her? I wondered. Next week? Next month? Next year? \"I don't know,\" he said. \"Maybe never.\" I had met the girlfriend at two or three parties we both had attended, though at the time I hadn't realized she was such. I announced to the Tiny House Man that I could not date him under these circumstances. I could, however, meet him for dinner in two weeks. A platonic dinner, we both insisted. FOR the second of our two nondates we met at my comparatively palatial apartment. Again we drank wine. Again we failed to make it to dinner. Again the angels sang. And this time they sang longer, more technically demanding, generally more satisfying songs than they had the first time. Thus, it surprised me when the relationship ended, which it did about 10 minutes later. The Tiny House Man said, \"Maybe we could do this again.\" \"Maybe if you stop having a girlfriend, we could do this again,\" I said. He let out a world-weary chuckle. \"I don't think that's going to happen.\" It appeared that the Tiny House Man didn't want a new girlfriend. He wanted two girlfriends. I said, \"I'm not some car that can be taken out for a test drive\" (when what I really meant, of course, was \"for yet another test drive\"). He said: \"Well, I'm sorry. That's all I can offer.\" I can't say that I dealt well with the news. \"I feel so used,\" I wailed to my best friend, Peyton, and I felt a little disappointed in myself: couldn't I come up with something better than \"I feel so used\"? To anyone who would listen I argued for my worthiness, enumerating all my good qualities: that I was smart and funny, that I didn't cheat on my boyfriends (or hadn't recently). \"I don't know why he stays with that tramp,\" I declared to Peyton. \"I mean, I'm better than she is. Aren't I? Aren't I?\" \"Of course you are,\" she said, proffering the only right answer. \"Then why does the trampy girl get picked and I don't? It's not fair!\" \"It's not fair\": someone had failed to remind me that the moratorium on pouty declarations of \"it's not fair\" had been in effect since the day I turned 7. Instead I became convinced that the Tiny House Man needed to know how unfair it was. And then I became convinced that it was he himself who could explain the unfairness to me. I dialed his number, and when he did not answer, I dialed his number again. And again. And again. And again. On the one hand I knew that my behavior was obsessive. On the other hand I was prefacing a majority of the calls with *67, which, it was my understanding, caused a phone call to be purged from the space-time continuum, as if the call had never existed. A few days later the Tiny House Man called and asked, \"Why do you keep calling me?\" \"I don't understand what you're talking about,\" I said. \"You keep calling me. The number comes up 'not available,' but I know it's you.\" \"How?\" I said. \"How do you know?\" \"I know,\" he said, \"because you called, like, five times, and I saw your number on caller ID. And then you called, like, five times, and there was no number on caller ID, and so I thought it was pretty safe to assume it was you.\" \"Well, I don't think it was pretty safe to assume,\" I said, even though I knew that, as assumptions went, it was about as safe as they got. I was even about to admit as much when he said, \"Look, this is all getting very 'Fatal Attraction,' \" and I was so taken aback by the carting out of that cheesy misogynistic cliché that I hung up. I mean, couldn't he come up with something better than \"This is all getting very 'Fatal Attraction' \"? A COUPLE of weeks later I was exiting the unfortunately named but tasty Whitey's Ice Cream when I came upon the Tiny House Man and his girlfriend. He said, \"Hi,\" as if to assure his girlfriend that I was a mere acquaintance, but I refused to acknowledge either of them. My head held high, I passed them, noting, with satisfaction, as I did, that they were neither holding hands nor standing particularly near each other. I thought about happiness, about how shared misery wasn't the same thing as intimacy. I had yet to entertain the much more radical notion that perhaps they weren't miserable, that whatever their difficulties (and clearly they had them) there might be something there worth preserving, that relationships were complex, imperfect systems. And that people were imperfect, that you might not have to be perfect to be loved, that you could be loved in spite of your imperfections or sometimes even because of them. Of course none of this had occurred to me, nor would it for a long time. And as I kept walking, my head tilting ever higher, the ache in my upper neck numbed only by my sense of superiority, it was this one thought that offered me any comfort, that lent my own tiny world some order: I look way hotter in my jeans than she does in hers.

       "      <td>HIS name was Jerry. A nice man, late 40’s, funny and smart, divorced with two grown children, a social worker who had dedicated his professional life to working with troubled kids. He was also — let’s be honest — the first to come around. He was the first man after my own divorce to raise an eyebrow, to take an interest after my ex not only moved out but moved on. Funny and smart and dedicated to troubled kids is all admirable, but in truth I would have said yes to a drink with a four-foot gaptoothed troll had one smiled my direction. The self-confidence of a 40-year-old divorced mother of two is a shaggy thing. So the fact that Jerry was also white I noted but decided to file away for now. Why worry about it right out of the gate? Yes, race had been an issue in my marriage — not the issue perhaps, but an issue nonetheless. What I did not know was whether race arose as a problem because I am black and my ex is white or because I am a person who grapples with race and he is not. That my ex does not grapple with race he would not dispute; he does not care to read, think or talk about it, and he wondered why I did. My ex believed I always went looking for race, but I didn’t; race came looking for me. And when it did, I would stand and call its name: when officials in our inner-ring suburb talked about closing our “borders” against a wave of nonresident students sneaking into our schools; when a white woman at my gym reached up, uninvited, and petted my locks like she was petting a dog; when my sick mother received one level of medical care and my ex’s sick sister received another. At such times he tried to understand my feelings, but he did not share them, and even talking about it made him uncomfortable. It’s a dividing line as real as any in America — those who grapple with race and those who do not. But like most dividing lines, it’s impossible to tell on which side a person stands by looking at them, or at least that’s what I thought at the time. So why get ahead of myself with Jerry? Why dig for land mines when I may not make it past the way he slurps his beer? We met for drinks. Sparkwise, I felt little, but we ended up talking and laughing easily for more than an hour. I told him I was a writer; he told me his five favorite books and how they had shaped his life. He told me he had gone to a seminary as a boy but eventually left the Catholic church; I told him I’d been raised a Pentecostal but mellowed into Methodism as an adult. We talked about our children, travels, mutual love of the blues and mutual dislike of the cold, and then he said he would like to read my books; he thought he would like them. I said he well might not. “How do you deal with it when people you know don’t like your work?” he asked. I quoted a playwright whose name I could not remember who admitted in an interview that he told his friends if there was a choice between being honest and being kind in talking about his work, they should choose to be kind. “Don’t value your opinion over my feelings,” the playwright said. Jerry nodded. “Some people use honesty like a weapon.” “Like a switchblade,” I said. “Like a bayonet. They slice up your heart with all these ugly, hurtful words and then, while you’re bleeding on the floor, they hand you a Band-Aid: ‘I was only being honest.’ ” “Honesty is overrated,” Jerry agreed. SO the following day, when he e-mailed his attraction, I tried to be both honest and kind. No spark, I wrote, but he was great, good company. If he was looking for “the one,” I was probably not going to be her. But if he simply sought intelligent dinner companionship some Friday evening, I’d be more than game. Not a bayonet, I thought, but a butter knife. And still it hurt. “Ouch,” he replied, and disappeared. By the time he resurfaced a few months later, I had suffered through two terrible blind dates, joined an online dating service, carried on several e-mail conversations that died, actually talked on the phone with a few men, met three for drinks, backed away carefully from each, then canceled the service. A few of these men were black, the others white, and in no case did I find anything remotely resembling chemistry. In fact, so utterly lacking in connection were these encounters that it made me appreciate anew how rare is connection. In the face of human isolation, race seemed to retreat a little. So when Jerry called again, I decided to let the spark thing coast, because at least he and I could talk. “My wounds are licked,” Jerry said. “Have dinner with me.” “Why not,” I said. Maybe, in time, the spark would come. We talked and laughed for four hours, then necked like teenagers in the parking lot in the rain. The next day we e-mailed and text-messaged each other. It was all so much fun, such a heady relief after the months of loneliness. But then, on our third date, things changed. First,he was late and I was irritable. Earlier, I’d had a frustrating discussion with several white undergraduates in my Literature of Slavery class. All semester I had struggled to teach them to think critically about race and slavery and history, to have them challenge their assumptions. They insisted, for example, that racial divisions were as old as time and that the myth of African inferiority preceded slavery, not, as I suggested, the other way around. And they argued that racial genetics were more than skin deep, whether I wanted to believe it or not. How else to account for the way black athletes dominate some professional sports? That evening, when I shared my frustrations with Jerry, he wondered if the students didn’t have a point. “What about all those Kenyan marathon runners?” he asked. “Isn’t it possible there’s some genetic reason for that? Isn’t it possible blacks are just better athletes than whites?” A PERFECTLY innocent question. Yet something small and painful flickered inside my chest. Logically, if one accepts a genetic physical superiority of blacks, one must also accept the possibility of intellectual superiority in whites. Did he not consider that notion? Did he reject it out of hand, or subconsciously believe it? And if I wondered these things aloud would he, like my ex, judge me bitter or oversensitive? I mentioned an essay I’d given my students in which the anti-racism advocate Tim Wise suggests that no one brought up in America can claim to be free of racist indoctrination, that doing so only perpetuates the crime. “What Wise says is that we all must recognize and confront the legacy of the past,” I explained. “I don’t think everyone is racist,” Jerry said. “Maybe racialized. But that’s not a bad thing.” By now my hands were trembling, so I did not ask what he meant by that. I had the feeling that even if he tried to explain I would not understand. I engage with race, but not all black people do. I know several interracial couples in which both people swear race is never an issue, almost never comes up at all. I believe them, but it amazes me. And I know one thing: I can never join that pack. My ex did not grapple with race, at first because he did not have to, being a white man in America, and later because it frightened him. This difference was a small but steady river that ran between us, and the more he tried to ignore it the more I clawed at the banks, and the more I clawed at the banks the larger the river swelled until, at last, we were engulfed. A black person who grapples with race cannot be with a white person who doesn’t. Whether a black person who grapples with race can be with a black person who doesn’t is a different and unresolved question for me, but on the first point I’m solid. So when Jerry called and asked if I would meet him for a drink, I agreed, but this time I went onlyto tell him. We met a bar with billiard tables. He wanted to teach me to play but I said we wouldn’t have time. “I can’t see you again,” I said. He blinked with surprise. “Why?” he said, finally. I used my bayonet: “Because you’re white, and it costs too much for me to date a white man. It cost me to be married to a white man for 13 years. I can’t do it again.” “That’s ridiculous,” he said, after a minute. “That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard.” “Which proves my point,” I said. “It’s not ridiculous.” “You can’t be with any white man?” “No, I don’t think I can.” I may as well face it. Because, after all, Jerry was a good man who worked with troubled kids and lived his life open to relationships with people of different races. And yet I couldn’t be with him, even though, unlike my ex, he did seem willing to grapple with race. But he was nearly 50 and his grappling apparently was just beginning, whereas mine started at 5. For nearly 50 years he’d lived in America and yet it surprised him that race might even be an issue for us. There was an innocence in this, an innocence born of being white. An innocence I could neither share nor abide. “It costs me too much,” I repeated. We were silent for a minute. Behind us balls clicked and people laughed. “And now,” Jerry said, “it’s costing me.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>FOR the past decade, I have struggled with two competing images of the opposite sex: oppressor, and dream date. As a girl, I was in love with the idea of love — love poems, letters, stories, songs, even Courtney Love, for what seemed to me her well-worn heartache. Boys themselves, with their fake guns and dirty knees, didn't interest me much. But as they were my ticket to romance, I adored them more or less as a practical matter. In high school, during marathon phone conversations, cheap pizza dinners and long suburban car rides, I began to fall for boys because of who they actually were, or at least who I thought they might become. I still loved Love, but now the love began to stretch to real people.  And this is where things got complicated, because around the same time, with my working mother as a role model and an influential teacher as my guide, I started to identify as a feminist. I read, re-read, and underlined \"Backlash,\" \"The Beauty Myth\" and \"The Feminine Mystique.\" I grew enraged by what I learned. Enraged, and utterly confused. Who was keeping women down? Men. But who were just so cute that I couldn't sleep at night for thinking and writing and obsessing about them? You guessed it, the self-same.  Then I went off to an all-women's college, Smith, where I didn't see a whole lot of men. I joined the campus women's group and studied up on gender issues. My rage toward men in general grew ever stronger, as did my desire to meet that one specific man who could make my dreams come true.  I had fantasies of moving into a city apartment after graduation with some blurry-faced guy, my partner. We'd cook dinner together, read the paper in bed. Later, we would shield our children from sex-stereotyped toys and take turns driving to rid them of the notion that Dad is always the captain. There would be true equality in our home, and there would also be candlelight and Ella Fitzgerald records and adorable baby shoes in the hall closet. BUT when I graduated and moved to Manhattan three years ago, none of the men I met were up for my proposed life of egalitarian bliss. In fact, most of the young people around me—male and female—seemed to think of feminism as a quaint and unnecessary practice from days of old, not unlike churning butter. I remembered then what one wise women's studies professor at Smith had said about feminism: \"None of this means anything unless we can get men on board. That's not achieved by marches or movements, but by one individual changing another individual for the better.\"  I wanted to get men on board — or one man, at the very least — but I seemed unable to find an audience for a simple discussion beginning with the words \"I am a feminist and here's why.\"  Friends wondered why I couldn't leave my politics at the door and just go on a date for goodness sake. My uncles joked that perhaps I'd be happy if I could find a nice Irish girl to settle down with.  All of my relationships, or lack thereof, began to take the same shape. I would meet a man, and our first date would consist of that lovely unraveling of mundane details. Then would come the second date. With our vital stats out of the way, we'd begin to discuss other, seemingly benign, topics. But somehow, every road led to sexism. A comparison of our favorite movies turned into me complaining about Quentin Tarantino's senseless misogyny. Perusal of the dessert menu somehow ignited a screaming match about women's socially imposed body-image issues.  Often there was no warning. One minute we would be talking baseball, and the next we'd be embroiled in a standoff about pornography, which would end with me refusing to return his calls and express mailing him a copy of Catharine MacKinnon's \"Only Words\" without a note. Soon I began to recognize a familiar look on the faces of the men I went out with, the physical incarnation of Check, please. I knew that I could be too harsh, too quick to judge and probably guilty of the very sexism I railed against. But I couldn't back down.  I couldn't because the stakes are too high, and the large-scale issues of sexual inequality remain: Women still don't make equal money for equal work; we are still the victims of rape and domestic violence; we are, for the most part, still solely responsible for child-rearing and cooking and cleaning, no matter what our career choices.  But the smaller, more personal issues are perhaps even more divisive, more threatening, at least when it comes to romantic relationships.  In a country where you can't show a penis on television, the popular rap star Snoop Dogg can sing a song on the radio called \"Can U Control Yo Hoe,\" in which he says a man has to do what it takes to put his woman \"in her place\" even if it means \"slapping her in the face.\" Outside my office building in Times Square stands a billboard for the new HBO series \"Big Love\" — three women of varying ages stare blank-eyed and weary at one exhausted, oversexed man. Beneath them are the words \"Polygamy Loves Company.\"  A block away, there's a long row of sex shops and strip clubs. When I run out to grab a sandwich at lunchtime, men are waltzing into these places without so much as a hint of embarrassment. Who are they? I often wonder. What are their lives like?  It seems impossible that they all live in caves or in their mothers' basements. Most must have jobs, homes, wives, girlfriends. They are not considered abnormal, any more than the guy who purchases a Snoop CD, or tunes in to see how Bill Paxton deals with those three demanding wives, poor lamb. If this is the culture in which we live and love, how must men, in their heart of hearts, view women? When I think of men this way, as I often do, I want to go back to Smith and stay there among the shaved-headed sisterhood until I die. On the other hand, no matter how enraged I become, I still adore men and the possibility for romance they bring. I love the smell of a man's skin. I enjoy the breathless feeling of waiting to see if he'll call back. I like dressing up for dates and dissecting a dinner conversation with a new guy to determine if he might be The One. I admire the linear and decisive way a certain kind of man thinks, to my curlicue boundless overthinking. And nothing beats the feeling of a man's arms wrapped around me. Nothing.  I'll never fully reconcile those ideas, I know. But sometimes love surprises us with its timing and its lessons. Ten months ago, I finally met someone who, so far, has stuck. And to my Catholic family's great relief, that someone's name is not Irene. His name is Colin, and I liked him immediately. And so I vowed, this time, not to sabotage things by mentioning sexism right away. But on our very first date, he asked about my thoughts on the feminist movement (apparently, he had been prepped by our mutual friends). When he pressed the issue, I finally blurted out: \"I can't talk about feminism until you know me better, O.K.?\" \"Why?\" he asked. \"Because I'll scare you.\" He laughed. \"I'm not afraid.\" And he wasn't. He gets it, yet he's bold enough to stand up to me when he thinks I've gone too far. Confronted by my beliefs, Colin offers neither the typical blow-off of other men nor the mea culpa that I thought I was looking for. Instead, he listens and discusses sexism with me at length, agreeing most of the time, but not always. And when he disagrees, he says so, challenging me to think about my long-held beliefs in new ways, and occasionally even changing my mind.  In Colin's view, a man who goes to a strip club for his bachelor party is not necessarily a misogynist. And my argument that the women's movement has hardly made a dent ignores decades of true progress, according to him. But he has come over to my side in debates about pornography, prostitution, movie violence and domestic roles.  Not that there aren't moments when it seems like we're still looking at each other across a great gender divide. One discussion about sexual violence in horror films ended with his screaming, \"Do you ever just lighten up?\"  AND last night he mentioned that a friend of his, a screenwriter, was optioning a book that Colin described as \"a man's guide to stringing chicks along without ever having to marry them.\" \"And yet you think he's a good guy?\" \"He's a very good guy,\" Colin said. \"I don't know how someone can be good, but not do good,\" I shot back. I said this, but at the same time I thought about the friend in question, a man more devoted to his wife than anyone I've ever met.  Colin and I went a few more rounds before he finally said, \"I admire your passion,\" and I conceded that his friend was indeed a pretty good guy. Then we took a walk, got a couple of beers and laughed about it all.  Both love and life are rich in contradiction, and who am I to fight it? After all, I was the teenage girl with a framed photo of Gloria Steinem hanging on her bedroom wall, right beside a larger photo of a young Frank Sinatra.  And now I have fallen for a man who understands and respects my feminist beliefs, and who also takes me to dinner, holds the door, calls me Babydoll in a slow Southern drawl.  Embracing those contradictions has led me to discover a world between the harsh reality of sexism and the airy wishes of my love-drenched fantasies.  It's true what my Smith professor said about progress depending upon one individual changing another for the better. What she didn't say was that, inevitably, the change goes both ways.</td>\n",

       "100  A FEW years ago I embarked on an ill-advised romance. From the start I had significant reservations about the man: not the right reservations, it would turn out, but reservations nonetheless. For one, he held a part-time job at the local food co-op as a cheese cutter, and how long could I go without making a \"Did you cut the cheese?\" joke? Oh, not long. Not long at all. He was also an adjunct assistant professor in the local university's art department, and, as everyone knows, there's no one in this world more bitter than an adjunct. In addition he lived in a house he had built himself. There was nothing wrong with his living in a house he had built himself. What was wrong was that the house he had built was only big enough for him. It was 8 feet by 12 feet. It had wheels and would therefore be easy to flee town in. To make matters worse, the tiny house had a name. And that name was Tumbleweed. All this normally would have bothered me. But none of it did. Because, I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for a pretty face, and the Tiny House Man's face was very pretty, delicately featured yet masculine. Unfortunately it was bearded in the soul patch style, which can make any chin look vaguely pudendal, but that was nothing that a persuasive girlfriend and a lovingly applied coat of Nair couldn't eventually take care of. So the Tiny House Man and I made plans for dinner, and we agreed to meet first at the tiny house, so that I might see how tiny it was. Once at the house, which was tiny indeed, I was greeted by the Tiny House Man. I saw that he was wearing Teva sandals. I hate Teva sandals. He opened a bottle of wine, and it was not long before I forgot that I hated Teva sandals. THE Tiny House Man and I drank and laughed and drank some more and laughed some more and forgot completely about going to dinner. At one point he excused himself to go outside. (The tiny house was not equipped with a working toilet; its builder and owner was, it appeared, a big proponent of composting.) While he relieved himself, I sat on the tiny floor of his tiny house and looked at his one bookshelf, which was stocked exclusively with books about tiny houses and a good number of tantric sex manuals. When he returned from communing with or, in this particular instance, insulting nature, he sat by my side. Very close by my side. I wondered whether our proximity was a function of limited real estate or genuine romantic interest. But soon our shoulders touched. And then our hands. And then our lips. The angels sang. And then the angels all of a sudden stopped singing. He pulled himself abruptly away. \"There's something I have to tell you,\" he said. I wondered what this something might be: I have hepatitis C? I'm a preoperative transsexual? Tumbleweed isn't up to code? \"I have a girlfriend, but she cheated on me, and I told her that I'd break up with her as soon as I met someone else.\" I liked the idea of being someone's someone else. I didn't like the idea that that someone had a girlfriend. \"I'm flattered,\" I said. \"But it might have been nice if you'd broken up with her before you asked me out on a date.\" \"This isn't a date,\" he said. \"I don't know where you got the idea that this was a date.\" Now, a person who was smarter, and not so hard up, would have left the tiny house as soon as she heard the word girlfriend. But I was not so smart, and quite hard up, and the Tiny House Man was saying such nice things to me during our nondate -- how pretty I was, how intelligent, how witty -- and I grew more and more smitten with each addition to the apparently endless catalog of my wonderfulness. He said he wanted to see me again. I said I wanted to see him again, but what about his girlfriend? He said he didn't want to hurt his girlfriend, so he couldn't break up with her right now. When was he planning to break up with her? I wondered. Next week? Next month? Next year? \"I don't know,\" he said. \"Maybe never.\" I had met the girlfriend at two or three parties we both had attended, though at the time I hadn't realized she was such. I announced to the Tiny House Man that I could not date him under these circumstances. I could, however, meet him for dinner in two weeks. A platonic dinner, we both insisted. FOR the second of our two nondates we met at my comparatively palatial apartment. Again we drank wine. Again we failed to make it to dinner. Again the angels sang. And this time they sang longer, more technically demanding, generally more satisfying songs than they had the first time. Thus, it surprised me when the relationship ended, which it did about 10 minutes later. The Tiny House Man said, \"Maybe we could do this again.\" \"Maybe if you stop having a girlfriend, we could do this again,\" I said. He let out a world-weary chuckle. \"I don't think that's going to happen.\" It appeared that the Tiny House Man didn't want a new girlfriend. He wanted two girlfriends. I said, \"I'm not some car that can be taken out for a test drive\" (when what I really meant, of course, was \"for yet another test drive\"). He said: \"Well, I'm sorry. That's all I can offer.\" I can't say that I dealt well with the news. \"I feel so used,\" I wailed to my best friend, Peyton, and I felt a little disappointed in myself: couldn't I come up with something better than \"I feel so used\"? To anyone who would listen I argued for my worthiness, enumerating all my good qualities: that I was smart and funny, that I didn't cheat on my boyfriends (or hadn't recently). \"I don't know why he stays with that tramp,\" I declared to Peyton. \"I mean, I'm better than she is. Aren't I? Aren't I?\" \"Of course you are,\" she said, proffering the only right answer. \"Then why does the trampy girl get picked and I don't? It's not fair!\" \"It's not fair\": someone had failed to remind me that the moratorium on pouty declarations of \"it's not fair\" had been in effect since the day I turned 7. Instead I became convinced that the Tiny House Man needed to know how unfair it was. And then I became convinced that it was he himself who could explain the unfairness to me. I dialed his number, and when he did not answer, I dialed his number again. And again. And again. And again. On the one hand I knew that my behavior was obsessive. On the other hand I was prefacing a majority of the calls with *67, which, it was my understanding, caused a phone call to be purged from the space-time continuum, as if the call had never existed. A few days later the Tiny House Man called and asked, \"Why do you keep calling me?\" \"I don't understand what you're talking about,\" I said. \"You keep calling me. The number comes up 'not available,' but I know it's you.\" \"How?\" I said. \"How do you know?\" \"I know,\" he said, \"because you called, like, five times, and I saw your number on caller ID. And then you called, like, five times, and there was no number on caller ID, and so I thought it was pretty safe to assume it was you.\" \"Well, I don't think it was pretty safe to assume,\" I said, even though I knew that, as assumptions went, it was about as safe as they got. I was even about to admit as much when he said, \"Look, this is all getting very 'Fatal Attraction,' \" and I was so taken aback by the carting out of that cheesy misogynistic cliché that I hung up. I mean, couldn't he come up with something better than \"This is all getting very 'Fatal Attraction' \"? A COUPLE of weeks later I was exiting the unfortunately named but tasty Whitey's Ice Cream when I came upon the Tiny House Man and his girlfriend. He said, \"Hi,\" as if to assure his girlfriend that I was a mere acquaintance, but I refused to acknowledge either of them. My head held high, I passed them, noting, with satisfaction, as I did, that they were neither holding hands nor standing particularly near each other. I thought about happiness, about how shared misery wasn't the same thing as intimacy. I had yet to entertain the much more radical notion that perhaps they weren't miserable, that whatever their difficulties (and clearly they had them) there might be something there worth preserving, that relationships were complex, imperfect systems. And that people were imperfect, that you might not have to be perfect to be loved, that you could be loved in spite of your imperfections or sometimes even because of them. Of course none of this had occurred to me, nor would it for a long time. And as I kept walking, my head tilting ever higher, the ache in my upper neck numbed only by my sense of superiority, it was this one thought that offered me any comfort, that lent my own tiny world some order: I look way hotter in my jeans than she does in hers.

       "59   HIS name was Jerry. A nice man, late 40’s, funny and smart, divorced with two grown children, a social worker who had dedicated his professional life to working with troubled kids. He was also — let’s be honest — the first to come around. He was the first man after my own divorce to raise an eyebrow, to take an interest after my ex not only moved out but moved on. Funny and smart and dedicated to troubled kids is all admirable, but in truth I would have said yes to a drink with a four-foot gaptoothed troll had one smiled my direction. The self-confidence of a 40-year-old divorced mother of two is a shaggy thing. So the fact that Jerry was also white I noted but decided to file away for now. Why worry about it right out of the gate? Yes, race had been an issue in my marriage — not the issue perhaps, but an issue nonetheless. What I did not know was whether race arose as a problem because I am black and my ex is white or because I am a person who grapples with race and he is not. That my ex does not grapple with race he would not dispute; he does not care to read, think or talk about it, and he wondered why I did. My ex believed I always went looking for race, but I didn’t; race came looking for me. And when it did, I would stand and call its name: when officials in our inner-ring suburb talked about closing our “borders” against a wave of nonresident students sneaking into our schools; when a white woman at my gym reached up, uninvited, and petted my locks like she was petting a dog; when my sick mother received one level of medical care and my ex’s sick sister received another. At such times he tried to understand my feelings, but he did not share them, and even talking about it made him uncomfortable. It’s a dividing line as real as any in America — those who grapple with race and those who do not. But like most dividing lines, it’s impossible to tell on which side a person stands by looking at them, or at least that’s what I thought at the time. So why get ahead of myself with Jerry? Why dig for land mines when I may not make it past the way he slurps his beer? We met for drinks. Sparkwise, I felt little, but we ended up talking and laughing easily for more than an hour. I told him I was a writer; he told me his five favorite books and how they had shaped his life. He told me he had gone to a seminary as a boy but eventually left the Catholic church; I told him I’d been raised a Pentecostal but mellowed into Methodism as an adult. We talked about our children, travels, mutual love of the blues and mutual dislike of the cold, and then he said he would like to read my books; he thought he would like them. I said he well might not. “How do you deal with it when people you know don’t like your work?” he asked. I quoted a playwright whose name I could not remember who admitted in an interview that he told his friends if there was a choice between being honest and being kind in talking about his work, they should choose to be kind. “Don’t value your opinion over my feelings,” the playwright said. Jerry nodded. “Some people use honesty like a weapon.” “Like a switchblade,” I said. “Like a bayonet. They slice up your heart with all these ugly, hurtful words and then, while you’re bleeding on the floor, they hand you a Band-Aid: ‘I was only being honest.’ ” “Honesty is overrated,” Jerry agreed. SO the following day, when he e-mailed his attraction, I tried to be both honest and kind. No spark, I wrote, but he was great, good company. If he was looking for “the one,” I was probably not going to be her. But if he simply sought intelligent dinner companionship some Friday evening, I’d be more than game. Not a bayonet, I thought, but a butter knife. And still it hurt. “Ouch,” he replied, and disappeared. By the time he resurfaced a few months later, I had suffered through two terrible blind dates, joined an online dating service, carried on several e-mail conversations that died, actually talked on the phone with a few men, met three for drinks, backed away carefully from each, then canceled the service. A few of these men were black, the others white, and in no case did I find anything remotely resembling chemistry. In fact, so utterly lacking in connection were these encounters that it made me appreciate anew how rare is connection. In the face of human isolation, race seemed to retreat a little. So when Jerry called again, I decided to let the spark thing coast, because at least he and I could talk. “My wounds are licked,” Jerry said. “Have dinner with me.” “Why not,” I said. Maybe, in time, the spark would come. We talked and laughed for four hours, then necked like teenagers in the parking lot in the rain. The next day we e-mailed and text-messaged each other. It was all so much fun, such a heady relief after the months of loneliness. But then, on our third date, things changed. First,he was late and I was irritable. Earlier, I’d had a frustrating discussion with several white undergraduates in my Literature of Slavery class. All semester I had struggled to teach them to think critically about race and slavery and history, to have them challenge their assumptions. They insisted, for example, that racial divisions were as old as time and that the myth of African inferiority preceded slavery, not, as I suggested, the other way around. And they argued that racial genetics were more than skin deep, whether I wanted to believe it or not. How else to account for the way black athletes dominate some professional sports? That evening, when I shared my frustrations with Jerry, he wondered if the students didn’t have a point. “What about all those Kenyan marathon runners?” he asked. “Isn’t it possible there’s some genetic reason for that? Isn’t it possible blacks are just better athletes than whites?” A PERFECTLY innocent question. Yet something small and painful flickered inside my chest. Logically, if one accepts a genetic physical superiority of blacks, one must also accept the possibility of intellectual superiority in whites. Did he not consider that notion? Did he reject it out of hand, or subconsciously believe it? And if I wondered these things aloud would he, like my ex, judge me bitter or oversensitive? I mentioned an essay I’d given my students in which the anti-racism advocate Tim Wise suggests that no one brought up in America can claim to be free of racist indoctrination, that doing so only perpetuates the crime. “What Wise says is that we all must recognize and confront the legacy of the past,” I explained. “I don’t think everyone is racist,” Jerry said. “Maybe racialized. But that’s not a bad thing.” By now my hands were trembling, so I did not ask what he meant by that. I had the feeling that even if he tried to explain I would not understand. I engage with race, but not all black people do. I know several interracial couples in which both people swear race is never an issue, almost never comes up at all. I believe them, but it amazes me. And I know one thing: I can never join that pack. My ex did not grapple with race, at first because he did not have to, being a white man in America, and later because it frightened him. This difference was a small but steady river that ran between us, and the more he tried to ignore it the more I clawed at the banks, and the more I clawed at the banks the larger the river swelled until, at last, we were engulfed. A black person who grapples with race cannot be with a white person who doesn’t. Whether a black person who grapples with race can be with a black person who doesn’t is a different and unresolved question for me, but on the first point I’m solid. So when Jerry called and asked if I would meet him for a drink, I agreed, but this time I went onlyto tell him. We met a bar with billiard tables. He wanted to teach me to play but I said we wouldn’t have time. “I can’t see you again,” I said. He blinked with surprise. “Why?” he said, finally. I used my bayonet: “Because you’re white, and it costs too much for me to date a white man. It cost me to be married to a white man for 13 years. I can’t do it again.” “That’s ridiculous,” he said, after a minute. “That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard.” “Which proves my point,” I said. “It’s not ridiculous.” “You can’t be with any white man?” “No, I don’t think I can.” I may as well face it. Because, after all, Jerry was a good man who worked with troubled kids and lived his life open to relationships with people of different races. And yet I couldn’t be with him, even though, unlike my ex, he did seem willing to grapple with race. But he was nearly 50 and his grappling apparently was just beginning, whereas mine started at 5. For nearly 50 years he’d lived in America and yet it surprised him that race might even be an issue for us. There was an innocence in this, an innocence born of being white. An innocence I could neither share nor abide. “It costs me too much,” I repeated. We were silent for a minute. Behind us balls clicked and people laughed. “And now,” Jerry said, “it’s costing me.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "87   FOR the past decade, I have struggled with two competing images of the opposite sex: oppressor, and dream date. As a girl, I was in love with the idea of love — love poems, letters, stories, songs, even Courtney Love, for what seemed to me her well-worn heartache. Boys themselves, with their fake guns and dirty knees, didn't interest me much. But as they were my ticket to romance, I adored them more or less as a practical matter. In high school, during marathon phone conversations, cheap pizza dinners and long suburban car rides, I began to fall for boys because of who they actually were, or at least who I thought they might become. I still loved Love, but now the love began to stretch to real people.  And this is where things got complicated, because around the same time, with my working mother as a role model and an influential teacher as my guide, I started to identify as a feminist. I read, re-read, and underlined \"Backlash,\" \"The Beauty Myth\" and \"The Feminine Mystique.\" I grew enraged by what I learned. Enraged, and utterly confused. Who was keeping women down? Men. But who were just so cute that I couldn't sleep at night for thinking and writing and obsessing about them? You guessed it, the self-same.  Then I went off to an all-women's college, Smith, where I didn't see a whole lot of men. I joined the campus women's group and studied up on gender issues. My rage toward men in general grew ever stronger, as did my desire to meet that one specific man who could make my dreams come true.  I had fantasies of moving into a city apartment after graduation with some blurry-faced guy, my partner. We'd cook dinner together, read the paper in bed. Later, we would shield our children from sex-stereotyped toys and take turns driving to rid them of the notion that Dad is always the captain. There would be true equality in our home, and there would also be candlelight and Ella Fitzgerald records and adorable baby shoes in the hall closet. BUT when I graduated and moved to Manhattan three years ago, none of the men I met were up for my proposed life of egalitarian bliss. In fact, most of the young people around me—male and female—seemed to think of feminism as a quaint and unnecessary practice from days of old, not unlike churning butter. I remembered then what one wise women's studies professor at Smith had said about feminism: \"None of this means anything unless we can get men on board. That's not achieved by marches or movements, but by one individual changing another individual for the better.\"  I wanted to get men on board — or one man, at the very least — but I seemed unable to find an audience for a simple discussion beginning with the words \"I am a feminist and here's why.\"  Friends wondered why I couldn't leave my politics at the door and just go on a date for goodness sake. My uncles joked that perhaps I'd be happy if I could find a nice Irish girl to settle down with.  All of my relationships, or lack thereof, began to take the same shape. I would meet a man, and our first date would consist of that lovely unraveling of mundane details. Then would come the second date. With our vital stats out of the way, we'd begin to discuss other, seemingly benign, topics. But somehow, every road led to sexism. A comparison of our favorite movies turned into me complaining about Quentin Tarantino's senseless misogyny. Perusal of the dessert menu somehow ignited a screaming match about women's socially imposed body-image issues.  Often there was no warning. One minute we would be talking baseball, and the next we'd be embroiled in a standoff about pornography, which would end with me refusing to return his calls and express mailing him a copy of Catharine MacKinnon's \"Only Words\" without a note. Soon I began to recognize a familiar look on the faces of the men I went out with, the physical incarnation of Check, please. I knew that I could be too harsh, too quick to judge and probably guilty of the very sexism I railed against. But I couldn't back down.  I couldn't because the stakes are too high, and the large-scale issues of sexual inequality remain: Women still don't make equal money for equal work; we are still the victims of rape and domestic violence; we are, for the most part, still solely responsible for child-rearing and cooking and cleaning, no matter what our career choices.  But the smaller, more personal issues are perhaps even more divisive, more threatening, at least when it comes to romantic relationships.  In a country where you can't show a penis on television, the popular rap star Snoop Dogg can sing a song on the radio called \"Can U Control Yo Hoe,\" in which he says a man has to do what it takes to put his woman \"in her place\" even if it means \"slapping her in the face.\" Outside my office building in Times Square stands a billboard for the new HBO series \"Big Love\" — three women of varying ages stare blank-eyed and weary at one exhausted, oversexed man. Beneath them are the words \"Polygamy Loves Company.\"  A block away, there's a long row of sex shops and strip clubs. When I run out to grab a sandwich at lunchtime, men are waltzing into these places without so much as a hint of embarrassment. Who are they? I often wonder. What are their lives like?  It seems impossible that they all live in caves or in their mothers' basements. Most must have jobs, homes, wives, girlfriends. They are not considered abnormal, any more than the guy who purchases a Snoop CD, or tunes in to see how Bill Paxton deals with those three demanding wives, poor lamb. If this is the culture in which we live and love, how must men, in their heart of hearts, view women? When I think of men this way, as I often do, I want to go back to Smith and stay there among the shaved-headed sisterhood until I die. On the other hand, no matter how enraged I become, I still adore men and the possibility for romance they bring. I love the smell of a man's skin. I enjoy the breathless feeling of waiting to see if he'll call back. I like dressing up for dates and dissecting a dinner conversation with a new guy to determine if he might be The One. I admire the linear and decisive way a certain kind of man thinks, to my curlicue boundless overthinking. And nothing beats the feeling of a man's arms wrapped around me. Nothing.  I'll never fully reconcile those ideas, I know. But sometimes love surprises us with its timing and its lessons. Ten months ago, I finally met someone who, so far, has stuck. And to my Catholic family's great relief, that someone's name is not Irene. His name is Colin, and I liked him immediately. And so I vowed, this time, not to sabotage things by mentioning sexism right away. But on our very first date, he asked about my thoughts on the feminist movement (apparently, he had been prepped by our mutual friends). When he pressed the issue, I finally blurted out: \"I can't talk about feminism until you know me better, O.K.?\" \"Why?\" he asked. \"Because I'll scare you.\" He laughed. \"I'm not afraid.\" And he wasn't. He gets it, yet he's bold enough to stand up to me when he thinks I've gone too far. Confronted by my beliefs, Colin offers neither the typical blow-off of other men nor the mea culpa that I thought I was looking for. Instead, he listens and discusses sexism with me at length, agreeing most of the time, but not always. And when he disagrees, he says so, challenging me to think about my long-held beliefs in new ways, and occasionally even changing my mind.  In Colin's view, a man who goes to a strip club for his bachelor party is not necessarily a misogynist. And my argument that the women's movement has hardly made a dent ignores decades of true progress, according to him. But he has come over to my side in debates about pornography, prostitution, movie violence and domestic roles.  Not that there aren't moments when it seems like we're still looking at each other across a great gender divide. One discussion about sexual violence in horror films ended with his screaming, \"Do you ever just lighten up?\"  AND last night he mentioned that a friend of his, a screenwriter, was optioning a book that Colin described as \"a man's guide to stringing chicks along without ever having to marry them.\" \"And yet you think he's a good guy?\" \"He's a very good guy,\" Colin said. \"I don't know how someone can be good, but not do good,\" I shot back. I said this, but at the same time I thought about the friend in question, a man more devoted to his wife than anyone I've ever met.  Colin and I went a few more rounds before he finally said, \"I admire your passion,\" and I conceded that his friend was indeed a pretty good guy. Then we took a walk, got a couple of beers and laughed about it all.  Both love and life are rich in contradiction, and who am I to fight it? After all, I was the teenage girl with a framed photo of Gloria Steinem hanging on her bedroom wall, right beside a larger photo of a young Frank Sinatra.  And now I have fallen for a man who understands and respects my feminist beliefs, and who also takes me to dinner, holds the door, calls me Babydoll in a slow Southern drawl.  Embracing those contradictions has led me to discover a world between the harsh reality of sexism and the airy wishes of my love-drenched fantasies.  It's true what my Smith professor said about progress depending upon one individual changing another for the better. What she didn't say was that, inevitably, the change goes both ways.  "
